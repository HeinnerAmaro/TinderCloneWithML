gn820zt,Cooking,egg curry there are many taboos where men should not cook and in some cases men do not even enter the kitchen let alone cooking by themselves many men think cooking will lower their male ego so this video is initiated towards males of all ages that men can cook too there are many men out there who take it as a profession but on the contrary many men do not know how to cook and they feel shy or they do not even try to learn it cooking is not a gender role  anyone can cook if you try to learn it so this is our small initiative to break the stereotype that men should not cook guys you must remember that cooking is one of the basic life skills that one must learn for themselves i hope you like this video  https  youtu be yhnebl uru  https  youtu be yhnebl uru

lks10j,Cooking,tl dr   after all your other ingredients are cooked and set aside cook your sauce down in your empty wok pan until its fragrant and thickened then turn off the heat and toss your ingredients back in to coat their surface moisture will re constitute the cooked sauce and allow it to spread around    works for all kinds of sauces and keeps the sauces from drawing all the moisture out of your other ingredients making a huge puddle in your wok especially nice for sauces that need a char like gochujang soy ginger garlic   so none of us have industrial burners at home heating our woks to   f and sometime we end up with soggy stir fries because of that boo ive been making stir fries asian my whole life and have been frequently confounded by the occasional wet one i could do everything right working in batches minding my order of operations etc etc but once i added my sauce in my veggies would sweat and the rice noodles would start sopping it all up and steaming instead of frying and everything would end up less than the sum of the individual parts simple solution   treat your sauce like a separate ingredient not one you add on top of the other ones while they cook an ingredient that must be cooked on its own  do everything else first   proteins veggies starches and then your sauce at the very end reduce it down in the pan by itself   it doesnt even need to be on highest heat for this just enough to sizzle it this will give it that slightly charred taste i know theres a word for it without drawing all the moisture out of your vegetables right as it gets thick and on the verge of possibly burning turn off the heat add your starches and veggies and such back in and toss vigorously to coat everything the residual moisture from all your other ingredients will thin the cooked sauce out just enough to coat it and without the added heat from the burner to accelerate osmosis your veggies and meat wont sweat out all their moisture turning your stir fry to soup hope this saves yall a bunch of unsatisfactory stir fries the one exception is if your stir fry is primarily starch based like a fried rice or stir fried noodle dishes rice and noodles can go in without being  fully  cooked and they will sop up a ton of sauce liquid still recommended to do veggies separately though
gnlj48w,Cooking,this is a greeeeaaaat tip
gnlt75x,Cooking,this will give it that slightly charred taste i know theres a word for it wok hei
gnm6r4j,Cooking,top tip for you one use a cast iron pan i am of chinese decent grown up in asia and living in europe been trying to do proper stir fry for years without success until i switched to cast iron the amount of heat that cast iron pan can hold will make sure that your pan will not go cold when you add in all the vegetables two please give enough time for the cast iron pan to heat up i generally put the pan on medium heat to heat up then i start prepping all my vegetables by the time i have done prep the pan is hot enough three do not add any salt or sauce until all your veg is done cooking really four when adding in your wet sauce oyster soya sauce or fish sauce do not just pour it on top of the veg pour them into the pan from the side so that they have the chance to get heated from the pan before contact with the veg if this is not possible consider the method suggested by op
gnlsvfg,Cooking,i have a good wok and have never been able to get stir fries totally right the guides ive always seen talk about how the trick is to cook it really fast at high heat and pour your sauce around the sides at the end but for some reason i can never get it maybe im not getting things hot enough maybe my sauce isnt right somehow if im lucky i end up with a slightly soggy stir fry if im unlucky its either soupy or ive gone too far the other way and its burnt i havent heard of this before so ill try it out thanks
gnm37zr,Cooking,my evening would have been soooo much better if i had read your post two hours ago i did so much right on my broccoli beef sliced my flank steak carefully minimal soy based marinade i did the quick boil then ice bath thing on the broccoli was careful to diagonally cut the broccoli stems as they re great when given love then i took the wok out to the side burner on the grill i didn t adjust for having    x the meat and veg the recipe called for but my real crime was thinking the wok would get hot enough when everything is covered in snow that was dumb rubbery steak soggy broccoli an avoidable tragedy
gnlnfnc,Cooking,why wouldnt you reduce the sauce first set it aside then do the rest
gnlv98s,Cooking,great idea its the veggie or veggie meat dishes that give me a little difficulty so i usually under cook veggies a bit i will give this method a try although id kill for one of those   degree things with the faucet right behind it theory makes total sense
gnm1hei,Cooking,this is why i gave up on stir fry i always ended up with a gooey tasteless lump thank you so much this makes perfect sense i havent eaten a veggie for days im going to make one tomorrow
gnlvp7u,Cooking,you can also thicken the sauce with a cornstarch tapioca flour slurry
gnm3rmy,Cooking,you should also  use a blowtorch  https  www seriouseats com     hei now youre a wok star a fiery hack for stir frying at home html if you have one works wonders and my stir fried ingredients taste     times better
gnm8qd6,Cooking,if you have a turkey fryer those propane burners are usually rated between     and     btu you can use with a wok for a more authentic stir fry on their own you can get them for
gnltsmn,Cooking,i have no free awards but this deserves all the awards will definitely be trying this for my next stir fry
gnmavtu,Cooking,i heard this same trick from a caterer years ago apparently cooking the sauce separately is also very useful for doing larger quantities as it allows the cook to keep the parts warm and just do  assembly  as the final step
gnmhadb,Cooking,i think you might just be using too much sauce i dont have a jet engine burner either but i dont end up with gloopy wet stir fries as there isnt really enough sauce to cause gloopyness in the first place i started noticing that a lot of written recipes would have all this food getting stir fried and then the sauce is just like soy sauce   tsp and id be like one teaspoon thats nothing at all but in the end its often more of a seasoning than a sauce
gnmw1oh,Cooking,my stir fries suck but i am now going to try and make one tonight based on this post i always end up too wet soupy
gnmxw3n,Cooking,sounds like slurry with extra steps tbh
gnncxbh,Cooking,holy shit i love you ill report back with my findings and whether or not i want to fellate you later
gnnjsvq,Cooking,chinese here blanching the veggies in hot water for short periods of time   secs to   min then tossing with sauce once everything is done has given me great results
gnlyszn,Cooking,another tip i got from kenji is to very carefully remove the diffuser plate from your gas range and ignite the natgas stream with a lighter it doesnt work for all gas ranges but it works great on mine  https  www youtube com watchv jooakt u gk  https  www youtube com watchv jooakt u gk
gnm43ty,Cooking,my issue with stir fries is the meat getting a really weird texture lets say its chicken ill add it to a very hot wok and eventually my chicken is sitting in a bath of its own juices is it still just not hot enough
gnm5jhr,Cooking,this is excellent advice i just started doing it a few months this ago and it has made a huge difference
gnm7dzj,Cooking,it took me  years  to finally understand this honestly to this day i feel crazy doing it but it just works
gnm853w,Cooking,life changing tip thanks
gnma4nn,Cooking,this was always a problem for me ill try your way next time
gnmd66i,Cooking,i was fixing to make stir fried pork tomorrow
gnmf6ro,Cooking,read the woks of life blog
gnmg1fo,Cooking,totally agree i started doing this too and this really does work way better not only does it help reduce the sauce more it also properly cooks the sauce before all my stir fries were just tasting like raw soy sauce since that flavor overpowers everything else when its not cooked through i was afraid that cooking it by itself would cause it to stick to the wok but you can just deglaze it with a little bit of shaoxing wine or just water cooking the sauce makes everything taste so much better its something i wish i knew years ago
gnmixzu,Cooking,wish i saw this before i made lunch lol
gnmrgug,Cooking,thanks so much for this tip
gnmx09u,Cooking,in a kenji video he recommends pouring the sauce around the outer ring of the wok to allow it to boil off excess moisture then toss after trying that and removing the gas burner diffuser trick my stir fries have been incredible
gnn5wr2,Cooking,or you can just do what most chinese recipes call for and add a bit of cornstarch mixed with water at the end about half tsp to a tsp with a bit more water than that the sauce will be nice and thick and you wont have to go through the extra trouble of cooking it down
gnn6lj5,Cooking,whats a good asian style sauce for lo mein noodles ive been trying   tbs of soy   tsp dark soy   tbs sesame oil and   tbs hoisan sauce and adding     cup of water to help it spread around
gnn7o6x,Cooking,oh yeah this is similar to what i do for mongolian beef
gnn87po,Cooking,that s why i just got an outdoor wok burner i ve only used it maybe   times since i ve gotten it but that s because it s been cold af and snowy where i live i can t imagine not cooking without it now i used to get the soggy stir fries too cutting the ingredients the same size helps a ton you can still overload a wok even with a powerful outdoor burner too i did that once also you don t have to worry about the smoke or the grease splatter inside of your kitchen when you do this and the heat is far less intense since it can dissipate outside instead of making your kitchen a hot fiery inferno i mean i understand if you don t have the option available to be able to use the outdoor burner though and this is a good tip for you however if you re able to get a wok burner just do it you won t want to go back to doing stir fries inside anymore
gnni7s9,Cooking,thats interesting ive never had that problem but then again the way our family has always made stir fry is different than everybodys when cooking stir fry i never make a ton of it only a generous portion for like two to four people to eat with no leftovers we do not add our rice to the actual stir fry we always serve the stir fry on top of a bed of white rice we dont do noodles with stir fry just not a fan i have a a basic big pan i use that looks kinda like a wok i first saute the onions in some oil i then add the protein to get some carmalized color on it if im cooking celery and carrots i go ahead and add them when the protein is almost done because my family likes the celery and carrots cooked a little more finally i add some fresh minced garlic then i add some flour sometimes to thicken it that way or i add corn starch water mix after the sauce is made and thicken it that way both ways work then i get the sauce going i add all the sauce ingredients like ketchup and soy sauce etc so now the sauce is thickening crank up the heat start adding my veggies one by one in the order that they cook up the slowest we like our broccoli and cauliflower crunchy so that goes in last it does not take much time they cook really fast at high heat and the sauce is thick so it coats the veggies nicely without being a watery mess hence letting the veggies stay more crunchier so for me its about stir frying the veggies in a thick sauce so they stay crunchy on a high heat ive never had a problem with excess water but to each his own
gnniii8,Cooking,so none of us have industrial burners at home heating our woks to   f i was given an industrial burner a little bit before christmas and it is fantastic its like a jet engine i can cook in a t shirt outdoors while its snowing because of how much heat comes off the thing super fun to cook with and everything takes like five minutes at that heat
gnnkbus,Cooking,this is a fantastic idea
gnm2li7,Cooking,this is a game changer thanks
gnm0e9g,Cooking,definitely wok hei
gnltav7,Cooking,i think that s it but i m not chinese so i only know it from hearing it in videos
gnmssrl,Cooking,wok hei in india means do you have a wok
gnmfvz1,Cooking,no wok hei comes from the flame flare ups burning vaporized oil you get when tossing the stir fry and its really hard to get that at home because home burners dont have a big enough flame to really do that but cooking ingredients separately does help you get a better char which does taste better but its not wok hei
gnmxuv0,Cooking,for sure i ve been waiting for this day
gnma8q5,Cooking,i only know this because of uncle roger lol
gnn8h20,Cooking,wok ho wok heiiiii wok hooooo
gnmf4r8,Cooking,also works with thick carbon steel wok pans although cast iron probably works even better i usually get it so hot that it starts smoking slightly and only then i start cooking also i found that with these shitty electric stoves like the one i have its easier to just always have the stove at max temp and regulate the heat by lifting the pan or by adding cooking wine getting your ingredients to room temp first and not adding too much stuff at the same time is also a good idea i think
gnn1hp8,Cooking,just cook like the koreans one veg at a time each done perfectly i do my spinach last and add the garlic then once spinach is wilted turn off heat and add sesame oil and chicken broth powder to make it nice and salty toss with other veg and eat warm not super hot i do not think veggies need a sauce per se bit if i wanted one id do it at end like op
gnnjvxr,Cooking,yes cast iron i really enjoy using cast iron cook the meat get the fond cook the veg collect the fond what i do for sauces is to push all the veg to the sides making a round hole in the middle pour the sauce s into the middle of the pan and let it sizzle for a bit then mix all the veg back in cast iron works great to get some crunchy rice   spread it out let it sit and get crunchy flip over with a spatula onto the serving plates to retain the crunch edit  also dont crowd the pan like u foobaz says and basically what u tuftabeet says
gnmw7ux,Cooking,nah use carbon steel fam
gnm5siu,Cooking,if it s soupy you re probably using too many ingredients or using an ingredient that releases lots of water spinach tomato etc
gnmg8ey,Cooking,the problem is that your home burner is just not strong enough to cook the sauce that way that technique works fine at a restaurant but their burners are crazy when you add the sauce to other ingredients the heat from your burner is going to mostly go to those other ingredients because thats what takes up the most mass so it doesnt cook the sauce cooking the sauce separately means all the heat is going into it so you can actually cook the sauce through
gnm7rmc,Cooking,check out the amount of food youre trying to stir fry at once unless you have an extremely powerful burner you cant do more than a couple servings of food at a time also par cooking my veggies usually helps me get things done really quick and its a common technique
gnmcytk,Cooking,if youre using rice theres   simple things you can do   wash the crap out of your rice with cold water before you cook it go til the water that comes off it is clear   let it sit in the fridge overnight day old rice is much better for stir fry
gnnmui7,Cooking,youre probably crowding the pan its even more of an issue with a home range since they have less btus
gnm3g8k,Cooking,batches my friend   batches there s always next time
gnm713q,Cooking,next time dont par boil your broccoli either with sufficient heat in your wok and the right size pieces theyll cook perfectly fine and not go to mush on you
gnlnoci,Cooking,you can but when you reduce the sauce it gets stickier much of it will remain in the pan and the high sodium will draw out a lot of water from your other ingredients while you cook them then you have to deal with cold thick sticky sauce being added back in after it cools back down instead you can just do it last and also kind of deglaze a little bit to add to the sauces flavor profile same reason you make pan sauce after you make a steak
gnm3qss,Cooking,wok management sauce is pretty much always last
gnmgh1q,Cooking,some residue from the sauce will stick to the pan and burn as youre cooking other ingredients
gnlw1xj,Cooking,true but my point is less about specifically making a thick sauce that s just a nice byproduct and more about minimizing the time that the ingredients cook with sodium because that draws their moisture out while they re in the pan and ruining their char and all the resulting liquid just steaming everything
gnm59m1,Cooking,yep teaspoon at a time to thicken before serving pro move
gnm4kt0,Cooking,i don t have one but that s pretty awesome
gnnepxc,Cooking,nah bro a tbsp of soy sauce will draw five times as much water out of   cups of broccoli when added with heat heat plus salt draws out moisture if you re not burning hot enough to dissipate it then you end up with soup or you just add the sauce without the other ingredients in the pan cook it down and lose nothing in terms of flavor and quantity
gnlz1n8,Cooking,it works but definitely be very careful doing that home kitchens don t have industrial ventilation not to mention that the shooting flame could easily catch anything nearby on fire
gnm32di,Cooking,yeah lets not do that
gnm5niu,Cooking,if you re using chicken breast slices coat the chicken in cornstarch which will lock in any juice normal chinese marinade for chicken pieces in a stir fry is cooking wine corn starch white pepper and soy sauce stir fry turning into boil meat is usually   wok not hot enough   not enough oil or   too much ingredients woks are not meant to be full you are only supposed to use a small amount at a time this is also why meat and vegetables are cooked separately and then mixed together at the last moment before serving
gnmbncc,Cooking,you may also want to try a different brand of chicken or a different butcher a lot of chicken is injected with a salt water solution to plump it up this water can then come out when cooking
gnm4eam,Cooking,could be that it s not hot enough could be that your marinade is too wet unless you re brining a meat overnight or sticking something in the oven to roast most marinades don t accomplish much especially if you re cutting your meat thin for something like a stir fry could be that you re overcrowding the wok when i m cooking any protein in my wok i try to only cook volume wise about   cup of protein at a time any more than that is asking for sogginess and again a salty marinade will draw water out of your meat sometimes it s better to just char the meat in the wok and let your sauce at the end do the flavoring
gnmzp6f,Cooking,and eventually my chicken is sitting in a bath of its own juices youre cooking too much at once
gnnea7d,Cooking,this isn t really about the thickness of the sauce it s about not boiling the ingredients because adding sauce at the end with everything in the pan draws out a ton of water
gnm2mr0,Cooking,youre welcome
gnmuazo,Cooking,hey wok
gnm6a2a,Cooking,it literally meant wok breath
gnmwktb,Cooking,it isnt technically wok hei like you said however cooking your sauce like that is one technique used to imitate wok hei kenji has a few videos on it
gnn1yc0,Cooking,wok hei is the term they were looking for whether or not it s achievable with this technique
gnmotj2,Cooking,is he the one of general taos chicken fame
gnmgben,Cooking,its soupy because of what op said the sauce never cooks and reduces because the heat is going to the mass of the other ingredients instead of just into the sauce at a restaurant the burners are so hot that the sauce can cook super fast as its being poured down the sides but home burners arent strong enough
gnnmy4w,Cooking,oh and look at velevting your protein first
gnm8eig,Cooking,yeah it was like when you re jumping into really cold water and trying to convince yourself it wasn t a mistake that slow mo regret reel before you hit the cold water i even thought  two batches might be better but f k it s cold out here  before dumping all the beef in
gnmjjdq,Cooking,wooow great insight always good to learn why we do certain techniques
gnmkbq1,Cooking,true but shouldn t sauce always be added last besides bean sprouts or garnishes of course in a stir fry anyways why would you let the sauce cook over the burner for an extended period of time legitimately asking as i ve been taught to always add the sauce mostly last and have only ever had a couple of my   stir fry s come out soggy
gnm7g89,Cooking,it sounds like you re putting in a premixed sauce which is pretty typical for these easy adaptations of chinese stir fries i can see how that can lend itself to a very wet and soggy dish in the end many of these stir fry dishes these adaptations are trying to mirror aren t made by adding a dollop of premixed sauce in the end but rather by layering in different components at specific times during the frying process there s more of a technique and know how to it that varies depending on what you re stir frying
gnnfd1t,Cooking,yeah i mean id imagine your way works not saying it doesnt but i never cook the food in the sauce for long enough to draw much moisture out
gnmd1fm,Cooking,it doesn t actually change the gas output or combustion rate it just changes where the flame is directed effectiveness of ventilation would be the same either way
gnm609l,Cooking,i think my issue is likely too much chicken in the wok at once ill start working in smaller batches
gnmz4vk,Cooking,the miracle of instant marination is actually coating your chicken in cornstarch  and  adding oil you can also add a few other things to flavor the process corn starch allows the oil to soak into the meat which it normally cannot do when you fry the chicken pieces the oil that has soaked inside of it by way of the cornstarch causes the meat to cook throughout instead of mostly on the outside the steam is not as easily able to escape so there is a slight bit of gas expansion and the chicken will become puffy and  very  tender like the way you get it at a chinese restaurant if this is not done the outside of the chicken is what gets cooked the inside essentially gets steamed in its own moisture and often becomes tougher as the steam is quickky released
gnnk75l,Cooking,ive honestly never run into this situation and i cook asian food most days normally i fry the meat may have a marinade depending on the meat then the vegetables sauce excluding things like doubanjiang which require frying and noodles are only ever added at the end and unless the dish requires braising then the cornstarch or potato starch slurry is added immediately after and cooked until thick if you prefer using your method then feel free but there are definitely more convenient ways to go about it
gnn4h18,Cooking,wok mexican wok
gnm7iu5,Cooking,or hei can also mean smell so wok hei can also mean the smell coming from the wok when you fry the ingredients on high
gnmwylx,Cooking,agreed definitely adds good smokey flavor
gnmgm44,Cooking,chinese stir fries don t use sauces that reduce only small amounts of sauce are used unless you re making a braise hongshao or something with a lot of sauce mapo tofu or similar in which case you add water or stock for liquid for a stir fry all you need is a little bit of soy sauce oyster sauce cooking wine sesame oil pepper etc the sauce is never reduced
gnnegfh,Cooking,sauce is always added last the difference i m talking about is removing other ingredients first before adding the sauce to reduce then throwing everything back in just to toss and coat
gnm7m4b,Cooking,i don t use any premixed sauces unless you count gochujang or oyster sauce
gnm65d5,Cooking,when you re stir frying you should be able to see the bottom of the wok if there s enough meat in there that the pieces can overlap then that s when you are going to get boiling instead of frying
gnnl1m4,Cooking,home cooks don t need to fry normal chinese people just put cornstarch to prevent chicken breast from becoming dry
gnnl1rc,Cooking,you better wok b tch
gnm7orr,Cooking,this guy hei
gnmzxe9,Cooking,gong hei  fatt  fart choy happy new year bruh
gnnncgp,Cooking,is it pronounced like hey or hi
gnmhqft,Cooking,there are many kinds of stir fries yes many chinese stir fries are very lightly sauced or use thick sauces or use a thickener but this post isnt only about chinese stir fries and there are many stir fry sauces that are more liquidy and need a bit of reducing
gnm7tva,Cooking,hei mate
gnn4maa,Cooking,choy is cambodian for p ssy
gnmjun1,Cooking,you can accomplish the same thing with any sauce as long as you follow the process right i ve made probably   stir fries on my home range and only the first two came out  soggy  rest are crunchy and delicious you may be saut ing you re veggies too much and letting them release too much moisture before they can release it all high heat and quick cooking is the fix for this seriously a stir fry should take maybe   minutes to cook not including noodles of course sometimes mine are done within   minutes you may not be draining your noodles enough and running them through cold water after cooking will stop the cooking process and allow them to not be so  soggy  when starting or just let your sauce sizzle the point of putting the sauce along the edges is to let it sizzle and give it that smokey flavor attributed to a wok almost naturally  reducing  the sauce also cornstarch add in a small cornstarch slurry and you ll always find that the stir fry sauce has that  stick to the meat noodles  consistency instead of a runny puddle of sauce also fresh veggies always helps i find the older the stuff i use the less crunch i get from my stir fries which is incidentally one of the reasons i love them
gnm7x7t,Cooking,zhou san
gnmksb8,Cooking,i make a ton of stir fry too i have made stir fries before without cooking the sauce first and they came out soggy a lot of the time and ive never had that problem since i started cooking my sauce first separately i didnt change anything else one sauce i like is a teriyaki sauce thats nearly all liquid maybe its not technically reducing but it thickens while cooking it might be due to the sugar content but it does thicken
gnm86pj,Cooking,jo sun sic jor farn mei ah nei
gnml0oz,Cooking,i guess i just don t understand because it s never happened to me   the first couple times it came out soggy but i very obviously did not follow the recipe to the tee which i figured out quick because the next times i made it i did follow the recipe s and they ve come out crunchy and delicious ever since
gnm8b5d,Cooking,sek ting me sek gong sorry my cantonese only extend to ordering food
gnm8rn7,Cooking,being able to order food is all you need from any language mate
lk758f,Cooking,if you havent picked up the book you should consider it of the cookbooks ive been exposed to its by far got the lowest barrier to entry to cook from plain language describes every technique great illustrations but the biggest thing is its divided into   sections the elements of cooking and the recipes the former which is half the books length is a culinary course that covers just so much techniques ingredients the science behind how cooking works how to improvise etc the book sets out not to be a list of recipes to make but to teach you how to cook with what youve got and it succeeds basically it teaches you how to cook not just how to make things edit  i see both a lot of love and a lot of hate coming from the netflix show please bear in mind that the netflix series is really just promotional material its not an adaptation dont make a judgement either way based on it and yes anyone thats touched the book can tell some of the people complaining in the comments watched the show without touching the book edit   for those of you wondering about if you should buy the book after watching the show heres my suggestion if you liked the show buy the book regardless of what you liked about the show you will find more of it in the book and will enjoy it if you didnt like the show because it didnt teach you much buy the book anyway because the book teaches what you were expecting the show to if you didnt like the show because you didnt like her or the tone the show set do not buy this book it is more of her and the tone is the same you will not enjoy it
gnifant,Cooking,i agree amazing book and a great series but i d strongly suggest it as a combination read with the food lab i think not saying one is better or worse just two incredible works some recipes but more how to think about food and how to think about how things work and why if you liked one you d like the other
gnii26d,Cooking,hey if you loved that check out her quarantine podcast home cooking
gnidbs6,Cooking,i would agree i learned so much about the basics of cooking how different ingredients compliment work against each other and how simple and great tasting food can come from a few fresh ingredients i have it on my nightstand and read it sometimes before going to bed check out the netflix series too its pretty good
gnigjt3,Cooking,for me its always going to be joy of cooking it has everything   recipes techniques inspiration
gnifoxn,Cooking,yeah it changed my culinary world
gnigh96,Cooking,agree i forced it on my whole family and now they re obsessed

gniivso,Cooking,its a good book for kitchen newbs im sticking with bittmans how to cook everything
gnimyex,Cooking,if youve watched the netflix series ive loved the series is still worth picking up the book does it give a lot more information in the first part of the book
gnipg3g,Cooking,after seeing nosrats great show on netflix im getting the book you have confirmed my hopes for what it would be its also really nice seeing someone being able to talk about food and make food without screaming their head off i love her calm presence i really wonder what master chef would look like if she got to reinvent it
gnif2ur,Cooking,it really is an amazing book but it always annoyed me that it completely misses out how sweetness can revolutionize recipes i just wish she had added one more chapter
gnihwqs,Cooking,love love love this book got it this year as a christmas gift and it changed the game for me took me from an average cook to chef quality food enjoyed the netflix miniseries as well
gnihfti,Cooking,sfah completely changed my cooking for the better can t sing samin s praises
gnigj9v,Cooking,i watched this on netflix a few years ago and it made so much sense in regards to how to cook put together delicious recipes i learned a lot and it changed the way i view ingredients
gniht1t,Cooking,i want to like this book but i struggle with two aspects of it first i struggled a little bit with samins tendency towards self congratulation shes obviously a prodigious chef and has earned the right to brag a bit but i dont really understand the purpose of including those little stories like one time i almost messed up the dough but then i didnt and everyone agreed it was amazing dough especially since in those moments she generally declines to explain exactly  how  she saved it and why what she did was even wrong in the first place if it ended up working out so well second i wish she had a slightly wider variety of examples the examples and exercises she gives are heavily geared towards her own tastes if you dont like blue cheese for example which she clearly adores youre left trying to figure out an equivalent exercise on your own for her numerous examples where blue cheese is her fat of choice
gnj8zau,Cooking,gave it to my daughter who claims she doesnt now how to cook despite being taught when she was still at home and she gave it gave it back last summer i give up let her eat frozen pot pies and takeout if she wishes although she does get super excited when i bring her food from my kitchen
gniievv,Cooking,what didnt sit with me in the netflix series is that it started with fat why not follow the title or change the title it was just really weird i actually stopped it thinking i missed an episode
gnivpqt,Cooking,great book and netflix show worth checking out favourite page is definitely the pull out spice wheel of the world
gnjbjck,Cooking,i love this book picked it up after watching the netflix show and have used it many times personally i will typically gift kenji s  the food lab  to family members that are starting out on their own i feel like it is this generations version of  the joy of cooking  after saying this i would still highly recommend sfat to any new home cook as a starting place or adjunct to their cookbook collection for the reasons op has listed
gnihi3u,Cooking,oh wow i really have to pick it up now haha ive only watched the netflix series and that already makes it sound fun
gniydgo,Cooking,making that buttermilk chicken tonight so flippin good
gnjgtqu,Cooking,chef here   years sfah is a good book not bashing it this book is a much more relatable book hot sour salty sweet  a culinary journey through southeast asia this is an older book and the foundation in principle of sfah the basic styles are the same it is a useful book and a great read i highly recommend
gniog5h,Cooking,i m on episode three of the netflix show i like it and you can really see she loves food and not like some basic person who says they  love  food she truly loves and respects all aspects of food
gnil0lt,Cooking,would you recommend it to someone who s vegan how heavily animal centric are the techniques in the book
gnij4vh,Cooking,that s good to know i loved the netflix series so i ve always wondered how the book is i ll definitely check it out now
gniwljd,Cooking,didnt realise there was a book will have to get it the netflix series was a game changer for me in the way i understand cooking
gnjqqp6,Cooking,i always suggest people just watch alton brown good eats thats how i learned how to cook he explains whats going on scientifically and molecularly but in an entertaining way but ive never looked into the salt acid heat book i didnt live the netflix show it kind of seemed like it didnt know what it should be and didnt have much for substance from what i remember maybe im just not the target audience for it since ive got a good foundation i read more serious eats blog with the food lab
gnj13a4,Cooking,america s test kitchen will always be my go to
gnihu87,Cooking,yes
gnilee7,Cooking,i mostly agree theres a ton of great information and the book does a great job at teaching cooking rather than just listing recipes however this book doesnt even come close to comparing to the food lab in my opinion sooo if you havent checked that one out i would look into it
gnithi9,Cooking,that sounds good that combined with the flavor bible will give you a good start
gnivq2i,Cooking,just ordered a copy
gnj3qa7,Cooking,anyone listened to it as an audiobook honestly i was surprised to even see that as an option for a cookbook and guessing it would a be a bad idea but wondering if anyone tried it in that format
gnj89ek,Cooking,its a fantastic book but i feel like its best for someone other than a rank beginner if you just read the first half and follow some suggestions your cooking will improve dramatically but its better if you have a few regular go to recipes you make if someone is just trying to get a start id recommend a book with simple easy recipes first not sure what that would be of course
gnjb934,Cooking,agreed i ve gifted this book to so many people the recipes are a  and it gave me the knowledge to cook without a recipe my husband says my cooking got noticeably better after i read it
gnjd8fn,Cooking,i just got the book yesterday for valentines day from my husband and cant wait to dive in so happy to get another recommendation with food lab   btw i loved the netflix show first which in turn caused me to want the sfah book
gnjevtg,Cooking,i really love that it has everything science technique recipes and heart i love the parts where shes talking about her formative experiences with foods and cooking the cucumber sandwich anecdote comes to mind all the time
gnjl4no,Cooking,another good introductory one is   recipes by cal peternell  https  www goodreads com en book show  twelve recipes     when his oldest son was leaving for college cal peternell the chef of san francisco s legendary chez panisse realized that although he regularly made dinners for his family he d never taught them the basics of cooking based on the life altering course of instruction he prepared and honed through many phone calls with his son twelve recipes is the ultimate introduction to the kitchen peternell focuses on the core foods and dishes that comprise a successful home cook s arsenal each building skill upon skill from toast eggs and beans to vinaigrettes pasta with tomato and rice to vegetables soup meats and cake coincidentally im pretty sure samin nosrat got her first culinary experience at chez panisse where she begged to work at following one mind blowing meal which basically changed her life
gnjl58j,Cooking,dont say you love the anime if you havent read the manga
gnjnxie,Cooking,the first half of the book is what i had hoped basics with babish would have been now i understand that andrew means basic recipes not knowledge   skills
gnjui3r,Cooking,harold mcgee the cia textbook or french if you know you know
gnkasf9,Cooking,would also suggest  i m just here for the food  and  how to cook everything
gnkecno,Cooking,i got  salt fat acid heat  from my local library renewed it repeatedly and considered buying it because it was so chock a block full of interesting stuff because im old  f and ive weeded out and tossed a ton of cookbooks in the last   years quick online access will do that i am very hesitant when it comes to adding to my current small cookbook library now youve gone and reminded me that i want this cookbook
gnkwnl9,Cooking,thats it im buying it now
gnlriq3,Cooking,i think the acid   heat lessons are the real golden nuggets from that book i think once you get beyond rudimentary cooking skills you quickly realise the role fat and salt play in everything but elevating dishes with a touch of acidity is a real game changer
gnir7gq,Cooking,the author of this book also has a podcast called home cooking it s a great listen and gives lots of helpful cooking tips
gnixhz7,Cooking,you should give the author credit  samin nosrat even though i didnt like the book
gnil6ps,Cooking,been wanting this cookbook for a long time but was quite very disappointed by the netflix show
gnitalw,Cooking,it s a great series on netflix too
gnjnqlt,Cooking,i really liked her book but there was like one line that kinda cheesed me something about oh just travel around the world if you really want to learn how to cook i get the sentiment but reading that during quarantine and on a strict budget was a bit grating haha otherwise i loved reading it and detailed explanations as the what why and hows of cooking i already have some experience cooking but it really honed my chops
gnishc5,Cooking,i love that book mostly because the scrambled eggs recipe is fucking killer
gnistd6,Cooking,my local bookstore carries two versions    one with the title words each in their own bright colors and with a horizontal row of various illustrated ingredients and condiments the fonts are fun and almost childlike   one in various brown notes with four illustrations in a grid two circles two squares that seem like close ups of cell structures or something the font is very neat and minimal i cant tell if theres any difference between these versions do any of you know
gnithw2,Cooking,for me its michael ruhlmans ratio it doesnt teach cooking per se more teaches you about how to adapt food based on what you can access
gnj0byr,Cooking,all mentioned are great books i always tell people who ask me what to get when they first get the spark is on cooking get an older version for really cheap online and youll be a pro by the time youre done with that book mastering the basics makes it so you can cook just about anything
gnj3uhh,Cooking,thanks i m always looking for more books like this
gnj4373,Cooking,i received this as a gift for christmas and have been meaning to sit down and read it
gnj499k,Cooking,thanks for the recommendation
gnj4j6a,Cooking,took this book out at the library a while back and i agree im still hoping my so will gift this one to me for a birthday or something i really want my own copy so i can write in it   theres a whole section dedicated to putting your own notes etc and that appeals to me samin nosrat also has a netflix show based on this book and a podcast called home cooking where she answers listeners questions about cooking and recipes
gnj4wd9,Cooking,i got a copy for christmas and love it
gnj6g5w,Cooking,just bought this yesterday
gnj786s,Cooking,it s more of an advanced beginner book focusing less on technique and more how various types of recipes are similar and can open up your cooking it s also a little disjointed in its writing style at times but lateral cooking by niki segnit is a must read
gnjhqcm,Cooking,i ve seen it and wanted to buy it but haven t yet i do like her based on the series and can tell you from   years experience as a cook that the first   years of my career i didn t understand the importance of acid in dishes so i definitely could ve used the cookbook back in the day it is definitely on my list
gnjhwg9,Cooking,never read the book or anything associated with it but just the title alone has changed how i look at cooking suddenly i have cooking instincts
gnji5qz,Cooking,it is a bad ass book
gnji73d,Cooking,the netflix series was really interesting but it lacked depth the format probably had a lot to do with it and didn t lend itself for more definitely made me want to read the book
gnjk7b2,Cooking,this book plus twelve recipes and the food lab completely changed my approach to the kitchen
gnjkwdd,Cooking,i enjoyed the show bought the book and enjoyed it too the elements section of the book was much more interesting and valuable to me than the recipes it gave me tips on how to better cook what i already cook
gnjlha5,Cooking,love salt fat acid heat i love her diagrams and illustrations that being said i love betty crocker and how to cook everything as my favorite cook books
gnjs6ms,Cooking,agreed
gnju8ct,Cooking,where cooking begins  by carla lalli music gets my vote for best book for complete beginners i think most beginners would be overwhelmed by the amount of information in salt fat acid head and most of that info is not necessary for a new cook to know great book though
gnju9yr,Cooking,cannot express my love for this book enough every time i read it im able to pick up a new skill or add a new technique it feels like a new book everytime
gnjzlj0,Cooking,the pantry section is such a notably thought out inclusion
gnk49tj,Cooking,i thought the netflix show was great and i learned a few things from it i dont usually buy cookbooks but id be willing to buy that one to learn more
gnk5469,Cooking,it s my favorite cookbook and she s writing another one that should be out soon
gnk5mp7,Cooking,i think it might be out of print but the cooks book is amazing   pages of techniques demonstrated through recipes
gnk686f,Cooking,it is an excellent cookbook another good cookbook for beginning cooks is better home and gardens cook book simple solid recipes and cooking lessons too
gnkamyb,Cooking,got this for my daughter for christmas and there on christmas morning she got out a notebook and started taking notes its that good i laughed at her and told her i didnt mean to give her homework for christmas
gnkaznm,Cooking,to go with it i would recommend mark bittmans  how to cook everything  the basics  for the same reason
gnkd012,Cooking,it s   on amazon right now literally just bought it thank you for the suggestion
gnke70v,Cooking,ive found mary berrys baking fundamentals book to be helpful in the same vein its so great to find a cookbook that teaches you about why things work the way they do when cooking baking
gnkf12i,Cooking,thanks for this i m getting it today any recommendations to learn about sauces
gnkgf6p,Cooking,i saw the movie and then got the book i didn t know there was so much about just salt
gnkgzom,Cooking,the book i thought was great and shouldnt be judged based on the short series i do wish they went more into the cooking and less on the good times cooking is fun vibe i mean i get it but it didnt sell me on the show
gnl0zzg,Cooking,best book the pull outs are incredible its the bible of cooking ive learnt so much from that book
gnlh0j9,Cooking,i bought the book salt fat heat acid and it is amazing
gnlryns,Cooking,i watched the netflix show before buying the book and while i enjoyed the show the book is basically the part of the iceberg under water i am your basic home cook and the book has certainly helped me elevate the quality of my cooking i recommend it to anyone who as o p stated wants to learn how to cook as opposed to learn to just make things
gnls1ik,Cooking,acid was something i never thought about in cooking until that show but also watching the most popular youtube food vlogger   strictly dumpling he would always talk about a dish he was eating needed some acidity if it was lacking it especially very oily or greasy dishes he would always say definitely needed acid because it seems to cut the grease
gnls69o,Cooking,sad she didn t tap into her persian culture more besides the last episode where she made a basic tadig
gnlsi0t,Cooking,thisll get buried but thanks to this thread i just went and watched the series on netflix i enjoyed it though i was worried it was going to be a little too much eat pray love some thoughts    wow she uses so much salt but i also have an unopened carton of that same red diamond kosher salt in my pantry so can i really use it like she does i do love my salt  theres no such thing as too much in my book but i just usually grind it   i did the whole low  no fat thing decades ago when dieting and it totally sucked id much rather have some high quality fat and over use my olive oil but i got a bit grossed out watching those pigs get butchered   acids are definitely essential and i found this episode most interesting i realized that ive basically grown up on high acidic meals it was interesting how she said a typical t day dinner needs the acidness of cranberry sauce totally relate to that however as ive gotten older i have horrible acid reflux and for example can no longer tolerate chocolate at all cannot drink juice rarely eat fruit other than berries not even in small amounts i am now wondering if all the hot spicy peppers tabasco lemon lime juice tomatoes pickles vinegar that i adore are a culprit it was telling when the one guy said you eat the spicier salsa for breakfast and lunch and the milder at dinner then again i also wonder if all that acid in a mexican diet helps with whatevers in the water that makes travelers sick my reflux started after a trip to mexico a couple of decades ago   i hope theres a season   and it includes food from india
gnluiys,Cooking,her tip to salt meat in my experience chicken a day before cooking was a game changer
gnlwl3v,Cooking,samin nosrat is a treasure if you don t like her there s something wrong with you
gnlykuy,Cooking,im an intermediate cook and bought the book because of this sub im only a few chapters in and already have utilized her tips and way of thinking and my dishes have improved its not just a newbie book it can help those of us with already pretty good cooking foundation as well
gnm06n0,Cooking,also a fun drinking game take a shot every time she mentions chez panisse it is a good book though that s elevated my cooking
gnm0lwh,Cooking,it truly does set the stage for understanding literally every cuisine of the planet since they incorporate each part differently and many in similar ways that you would never connect
gnmbbh5,Cooking,never read a more honest and helpful cookbook review i m in for the win   just ordered
gnilklc,Cooking,it teaches the science behind certain things but i dont know if it necessarily teaches you how to cook it might explain the  why  or  how  behind something but youll have to put it into practice to make it useful the problem i have is theres a hard time remembering certain references   youd think she would have that has a selling point on her site for the book but nope no such thing i want the data and reference charts i dont want the story and now i just used a link on her site to see something she linked to that now probably stores a cookie on my browser so she gets commission on shit i purchase dont get me wrong there are some things that are explained well that i have to remind myself of that have been helpful e g the process of osmosis when it comes to cooking something blanching in a way and how a foodstuff takes up water other nutrients
gnilx94,Cooking,im so tired of being recommended this book ive read it by now ok and it honestly reads like a giant flex i like that it goes into the chemistry of cooking but thats where it ends the information is accurate but nothing new and its written like a not so humble brag you pick up most of this information through experience in your own kitchen so reading about how someone else learned how to season food in a high end restaurant feels very patronizing i know ill get hate for this but ive been wanting to say something about it for a long time
gnijibt,Cooking,im a slave to recipies so that first part sounds like exactly what i need im still having trouble making pan sauces out of fond
gnj1ul3,Cooking,you should watch the salt fat acid heat series on netflix
gnj9cly,Cooking,i think good eats does the same job superbly
gnjboiv,Cooking,i thought it was an alright book the one thing that really irked me was when she was listing acids used in cuisines around the world and she listed beer for indian food im not sure if i can trust the rest of the book anymore
gnjl03c,Cooking,i returned the book just something about it was annoying did you know she worked for alice waters and her recopies were very basic good for a starter book but i did not work for me
gniiwzx,Cooking,i recommend this book to people in this sub  all the time   it is honestly my favorite cookbook and i ve got about   to choose from
gniu125,Cooking,how much of an issue is it that it uses us cups ounces etc measurements for someone whos used to eu measurements dl tsp kg etc id love to get it but been wondering if its going to be a big nuisance
gnj1a48,Cooking,does this book work as an audiobook
gnjn6jd,Cooking,ruhlmans twenty is pretty good too
gnjxriy,Cooking,anyone here a fan of carla halls cookbooks worth investing in
gnjzaw9,Cooking,sfah food lab modernist cuisine at home six seasons all central cookbooks in our kitchen
gnk1akh,Cooking,removed
gnk6pr1,Cooking,heres  summary  https  medium com  alanna irving my notes from salt fat acid heat d ae  of the book
gnkd53o,Cooking,ill have to check this one out ive heard the name bandied around before my go to for years has been how to cook everything by mark bittman i think
gnkf8if,Cooking,i took the book out of the library i have not watched the netflix show i found the illustrations distracting and not particularly helpful but i am old fashioned and graphic novels dont do much for me either i took out a physical copy from the library but i would check if an ebook version can be borrowed that way you can reach your own conclusion whats on my bookshelf lots of mark bittman madeleine kamman the making of a cook joy of cooking and a long standing paper subscription to cooks illustrated magazine
gnkglw9,Cooking,how s the netflix show
gnkhiy7,Cooking,i love this book i also love   books called what einstein told his chef part   and   such good reads
gnkiq0f,Cooking,if we re doing cook book recs i high suggest the american test kitchen cook book for   it s huge well priced and gives tons of recipes for   which helps a lot with food waste if you are like me and tend to cook enough for a   person family don t like leftovers
gnkkmlj,Cooking,how do you think it compares to  ruhlmans twenty  for a technique book
gnko1ss,Cooking,i would also definitely recommend the flavor bible
gnko5g4,Cooking,on food and cooking by harold mcgee not recipe book but a book on the chemistry of cooking
gnkqi3k,Cooking,i absolutely love that cookbook and i am a very experienced cook there s so many good recipes in it she uses too much salt in her recipes but that s my only complaint
gnkr2xe,Cooking,thanks for such wonderful tips  https  bestmasticatingjuiceronline com best commercial cold press juicers will try to follow
gnlec98,Cooking,man discovered  food science
gnm2ylm,Cooking,what about the good old joc i thought that was the standard
gnm3at5,Cooking,never underestimate the value of learning food science i never use recipes and i cook new things all the time does it always work out no do i learn a lot in the process absolutely i come up with about   new  favorites a year thats   new recipes in a decade i cook a piece of salmon and make   different meals out of it this sounds like a great book
gnnfu5p,Cooking,check it out from the library before you buy it then youll know if its something youll use
gnimtyy,Cooking,i was so disappointed in the netflix series there was just so little information and so much dramatic effect ill never put olive oil on bread i hate the taste of olive oil and surely most people know how to make pesto by now i didnt even watch it to the end should i give the book another chance edit  this is not to bash samin this really is one of the most recommended cookbooks but should i consider reading the book if i disliked the series so much
gnjp8wh,Cooking,i thought the title would be brought up in this thread what makes salt fat acid heat so special i can say that starch umami evaporation and caramelisation are important too
gnkynod,Cooking,jesus this comes off like an ad
gnjlgww,Cooking,alright alright after reading all these comments i felt like  had  to get this i just put in my amazon order for it so im pretty excited i know like absolutely nothing about cooking so i hope this gets me into it wish me luck
gnjnczo,Cooking,quick q would most of it still be relevant to someone following a vegan diet
gnjo944,Cooking,i watched some of the show it s definitely interesting and informative my first came on recommendations and was how to cook everything by mark bittman it s gotten good use i recommend cookwise for learning some techniques it especially has good information about making bread and the different types and brands of flours this book also helped me figure out some alternative flours to use by protein content and the like there s more to it than that but it gives you some ideas of what to think about if you re trying to substitute or add chickpea flour or similar to boost protein or make something in a gluten free version for the beginner i really recommend something that teaches techniques i wanted to learn all the way from how to properly hold the chef s knife to techniques for doing different cuts how to julienne how to chiffonade fresh basil how to dice onions and mince garlic etc i like a solid foundation of information more than a book of recipes
gnjyyf6,Cooking,not first cook book but third or fourth basic understanding of thermal transfer is one aka how diff materials transfer heat is just as important as this
gnj4jz9,Cooking,i found the book ok i suppose if you have never cooked before in your life it would be more use a lot of the information is very basic obviously salt makes food taste good yes we know olive oil is best suited for mediterranean style cooking and ghee better for asian style cooking etc the scientific explanations are also just fine i read the through the book expecting to think about my cooking in a different mindset but honestly the vast majority of the information was stuff i was already doing
gnju28p,Cooking,i m a vegan and i have even avoided watching the show because i know it will be discussing animals and animal products does the book teach one how to cook regardless of what they do or don t eat or does it have a lot of animal products that it suggests edit  who downvoted me for asking a genuine question y all are petty
gnkfvlv,Cooking,ill save you   salt makes food taste better it is the ultimate flavor enhancer it brings out the natural flavors of whatever it seasons try making popcorn from scratch its bland as hell right now add melted unsalted butter and taste now it s greasy bland now sprinkle it evenly with salt hot damn that s delicious everything you cook needs salt just don t overdo it as liquids like spaghetti sauce or soup cook they become more concentrated as they evaporate what might taste perfectly balanced at the start will be over salty after simmering for   mins you can always add salt close to the end to get it perfect you cannot take it away fun fact  if you do end up with an overly salty broth or sauce toss in a potato it will soak some of it up and possibly save your dish ever notice how much salt it takes to season mashed potatoes saltiness is perceived more at cold temperatures so beware of that it means that you should season at whatever temp you intend to serve at sometimes you don t need additional salt or much of it if your dish contains ingredients that are naturally salty parmigiano cheese for example or anchovies capers soy sauce etc fat is flavor even though we don t think of it that way it has a  taste  that is a combination of texture smell and what we think of traditionally as mouth taste it basically punches all our buttons think how delicious bacon is on saturday morning that intoxicating smell hits you first then the crunch as you bite into it gives you that crispy texture then the flavor in your mouth the smoke the saltiness and porkiness fat is also huge for mouthfeel because fats tend to coat your mouth many of those classsic french sauces are so creamy and decadent because they re full of butter duck fat heavy cream etc fat is also essential as cooking medium because it allows us to sear and cook at high temps which renders the outside of the food that delicious caramelized exterior that crisps think french fries while the inside remains soft while fat is delicious if you overdo it it can overwhelm your ability to taste why is eggs benedict such a perfect dish you re ladling fatty hollandaise sauce basically emulsified butter over an egg and ham fat fat fat it works because of the lemon juice in the sauce lemon juice is an acid which is the perfect counterpoint to fat it cuts through the richness and brightens it same with a nice fat juicy steak how good is that chimichurri sauce with it vinegar why do we serve rielsing with thanksgiving dinner because it s high acidity and a little sweet balances out all the fats you re eating from the turkey the gravy the mashed potatoes with butter and cream acid and fat go together like sweet   sour they balance each other they elevate each other they compliment and counteract each other you should always be thinking of ways to include both in your cooking even olive oil you don t think of it as acidic really do you but it is and its that pairing of acid   fat that makes it so delicious and versatile heat   there s almost too much to talk about with this but at the core always think of what your ingredients are and what your desired outcome is and that will determine how you use heat a ribeye will benefit well from a super high heat sear on either side to set that crust and caramelize the fat then take it off the direct heat and finish it in the oven where they ambient heat will cook it through perfectly if you have a tough cut of meat you want to think of low temp indirect heat that s why low   slow bbq pulled pork is so amazing the hours of cooking at low temps allow the meat to slowly break down and become tender speaking of the browning that malliard reaction is pure flavor that s why you always see the chef deglazing a pan with wine after searing something in it they re preserving all that flavor of the browning process to add to the sauce or gravy or whatever the end product is delicate foods like seafood or tender vegetables spinach for example benefit from short cooking times you want them cooked just through anything more and you re going to wind up with something a rubbery or dried out or both boiling is almost always to get up to temperature once it s boiling you usually turn it down to a simmer so that it doesn t break everything up for example a stew or soup you want your vegetables to be in chunks if you boil it you ll have mush
gnjtvc8,Cooking,how does sugar not make the list salt sugar fat its the trifecta the holy trinity the   legged stool i mean seriously
gnippd8,Cooking,the problem is a lot of people confuse this book for the cia confession extraction manual of the same title
gnim7w9,Cooking,i respectfully disagree it should be called salt salt salt salt the author grossly oversalts everything you cant taste the food
gnk9sug,Cooking,nope the best ever cook book is delia smiths how to cook she starts with eggs and there s a tv show to go with it
gnigosg,Cooking,i was recently gifted the food lab and am loving it this further confirms i need to pick up salt fat acid heat
gnj68md,Cooking,i got both of these for christmas from my lovely wife then good covid   weeks later and have yet to regain my taste and smell oof
gnihzed,Cooking,yes anytime i have a friend that is trying to up their game i always recommend them getting both books makes a pretty killer gift combo for someone you know really wants to get into it
gniwttw,Cooking,yes both books taught me the why behind choices i ve been seeing in recipes for years that foundation has allowed me to really have fun in the kitchen i give both books and a cast iron skillet to friends as a house warming gift
gnjfn16,Cooking,if you like the food lab another serious eats chef nik sharma recently released his book the flavor equation which i found to be a great compliment to kenji s approach of cooking i d add it to the likes of the food lab and sfah in my list of great modern cookbooks do check it out
gnj3yb8,Cooking,i was going to buy the food lab next after seeing it last year it looks great thanks for reminding me
gnj5rra,Cooking,which should i start with first salt acid fat or the food lab ive got both and havent really started on either yet
gnjfb1u,Cooking,any idea where to buy it amazon has it upwards of   right now i recently started watching kenji on youtube and i love his videos teaches us how to have a functioning home kitchen with stuff we probably already have
gnjh5o3,Cooking,yeah the food lab is my go to for suggesting a first cookbook myself
gnknzev,Cooking,imho  the food lab  reads much more like an engineering textbook
gnkpjcd,Cooking,unfortunately the food lab ist still only available in english and with imperial measurements probably
gnm2ger,Cooking,love the food lab i also enjoy his  youtube channel  https  www youtube com c jkenjilopezalt videos where he more or less wings it with ingredients he happens to have
gnijdgs,Cooking,oh boy the food lab comes across as misogynistic in reviews i haven t read it so have no opinion but the quotes from the book do not inspire confidence edit  sources for the curious https  www goodreads com review show   https  www goodreads com review show   https  www goodreads com review show   edit   for those that are saying  in his videos or in kitchens he does x disproving these comments   i am unfamiliar with the author i don t care about his channel i don t watch his videos of know who he is what i have to go on are quotes from a book so when i look at them i ask myself  do these seem misogynistic  yes or no there are no extenuating circumstances i cannot read the authors mind hear his voice or pick up his intent from anything but his words and a lot of the quotes appear to be of questionable taste at best but whatever if you can t step back from your other experiences of him and see that a lot of these quotes don t belong in this book particularly if he is who you want him to be i don t know what to tell you
gnimmac,Cooking,i binged it the last couple weeks and am devastated that it has no more episodes i loved the interplay and the call ins
gnjyle0,Cooking,welcome to part   of our   part series about cooking at home
gnitz77,Cooking,ah the old netflix adaptation meme
gnij2l0,Cooking,that was the book that got me started amazing how comprehensive it is and how accessible it is i always  always  keep a copy in my kitchen
gniwg9t,Cooking,agreed the joy of cooking milhouse
gnj0qsk,Cooking,i learned to cook with the joy of cooking there have been many other cookbooks but this book marked the beginning of myjoy of cooking
gninoxf,Cooking,honesty my go to is the martha stewarts cooking school i got that when i first moved out and its a book i give to my nieces as they go off to college
gnj7pbe,Cooking,just dont keep it next to your books on human anatomy
gnj425o,Cooking,i think for me it has to be larousse gastronomique which conceptually doesnt look like that different a book in some ways no nonsense pages crammed full of as many recipes as possible with some notes misses a bit of the preamble of joy by the looks of the google preview but still my favourite
gnj9iiz,Cooking,yes i really enjoyed salt fat acid heat but my god i would never recommend it as a first cookbook it doesnt cover any actual cooking its mostly theory joy of cooking combined with whatever internet recipes suit your fancy is all you need to learn to cook source  thats how i learned to cook
gnj7nbx,Cooking,the series is just promotional material it kind of mimics the mood of the book but thats as far as it goes if you enjoyed the series then i definitely recommend the book as you get that same energy but with significantly more useful information
gnixs25,Cooking,i think the book is way better than the series
gnknd0c,Cooking,watch australian masterchef and you will see
gnit7jn,Cooking,i havent finished the book so i may be off here but i believe samin implies that the four elements of salt fat acid and heat are much more ubiquitous and therefore are more foundational to cooking sweetness and umami certainly have a role but because not every dish calls for them it is seen as less essential
gnign47,Cooking,i would argue that if you take to heart the other chapters and do a little thinking of your own you ll manage to draw your own conclusions regarding sweetness while i agree there could be a chapter i also think the rest of the book prepares you well enough to not actually need that additional chapter anymore
gnki0an,Cooking,coming from a region in asia that adds sugar to almost every dish   amen
gnlfhdd,Cooking,enough
gnk9gfw,Cooking,the information was good but god what an awful show probably the most dreadful delivery ive ever seen for a cooking documentary great book tho
gnil35p,Cooking,to further go on with that   every recipe seems to have upwards of   ingredients which is not great for my broke arse who wants to make a simple broccoli dish but doesn t want to buy out an entire spice rack to do so
gniq5fq,Cooking,self congratulation are we reading the same book the first anecdote in the book is about how nosrat under seasoned her polenta by three palmfuls of salt
gnj7ivg,Cooking,hmm ive never heard that explained as self congratulation but i guess i can kind of see it to me it read as an explanation that food usually winds up being good even if you mess up the recipe in a few places i think its important to call things out like that   sort of like what alton brown does in his earlier seasons of good eats   to explain to new chefs that it isnt a trainwreck if you generally mess up a couple of ingredients in the recipe there are some things that are unrecoverable but generally your food will still taste just fine if you forget an ingredient here or a step there and new cooks never seem to intuit that fact
gnjbil1,Cooking,for the first part i strongly suggest people watch the series while it doesnt give you much useful information for cooking it does a great job of setting the tone of the book if her personality clashes then you dont want the book for the second thats an entirely fair criticism theres a lot in the book that i dont like that said i try to acquire the tastes while i dont like a lot of the ingredients that get used i really want to i know these ingredients are good and bring a lot of joy to people and id like to get in on some of that joy mushrooms were a big hurdle for me absolutely despised them taste texture smell no matter how they were cooked i just couldnt deal its taken a long time but forcing myself to step way out of my comfort zone has been a positive thing i love me some baby bellas in damn near anything what i mean is you can either look at it as i dont want to eat this or you can look at it as what am i missing out on
gnitli3,Cooking,deleted
gnj81ak,Cooking,sfah is a love letter written to a specific narrative regarding food it draws heavily on the idea that the writer is comfortable talking in positive terms about themselves to the reader and it requires heavy interpretation to make it applicable to a normal reader not completely full of themselves but once you do that its very useful
gnlfui3,Cooking,im with you same goes for the netflix series i want to love it but something about samins personality both in writing and her series rubs me the wrong way which is weird because i really enjoy her videos that shes does with food publications like nyt bon appetit munchies etc
gnj9axk,Cooking,i taught myself how to cook when i was a kid but when i went to college and after first moving out i ate convenience meals almost exclusively the effort in cooking just piled on to what was already an overflowing plate it wasnt until i was settled into my career that i got back into cooking and even then it wasnt until a few years ago when i reached financial security that i really put in the effort for it dont know how old she is or her situation but maybe shell come around eventually
gnimxpa,Cooking,i think it was because the fat episode was the easiest to get into so netflix decided to use it as the first so people continue watching
gnji23q,Cooking,added it to my list thanks for the recommendation
gnim5j6,Cooking,to be honest i wouldnt necessarily even recommend it to a vegetarian person or perhaps yes but with the warning that they wont find too many recipes techniques and hence wont make the most out of all the book
gnip3sv,Cooking,id suggest some of ottolenghis vegetarian cookbooks if youre looking for a veggie vegan alternative to sfah has a similar vibe in food combinations cooking techniques etc and hell normally suggest vegan alternatives for vegetarian ingredients
gnj49pn,Cooking,you might want to check out vegan with a vengeance and or veganomicon both by isa chandra moskowitz
gnjef8p,Cooking,im vegan and i have and use and love the book the techniques section is universally applicable stuff like what makes things crispy when to boil v steam etc and the recipes half of the book is broken down by main ingredient so i just skip the sections on meat fish and eggs if youre really put off by mentions of animal products   which is totally fair   its likely not the book for you but ive gotten a lot of value out of it
gnjjgxw,Cooking,i found the beginning part of the book pretty useful the basics of cooking with salt fat acid and properly using heat are perhaps even more important for vegan cooking especially fat and salt but she does spend a lot of time focusing on how to cook meat which i just kind of skip over probably better books out there for vegans but i vegetarian but cook lots of vegan dishes still got a lot out of it
gnjvu6x,Cooking,i would recommend america s test kitchen s  the complete vegetarian cookbook  samin does a great job of explaining why things work well together in sfah but there s quite a few non vegan dishes without recs for substitutes atk s cookbook does a very good job of giving you useful recipes as well as the prized knowledge about ingredients that samin is also great at sharing   but in a veg friendly form ottolenghi s flavor is extremely vegan friendly can t remember one recipe that wasn t vegan right now but does less explaining at the level samin is appreciated for
gnilckb,Cooking,i wouldnt recommend it to someone thats vegan my experience so far with vegans is most will find their own way to cooking through necessity whereas omivores run a wider gamut of a knowledge pool
gnim0yr,Cooking,i would definitely recommend the brief netflix series based on the book plenty to learn for all types of cooks and diets
gnj4zb0,Cooking,you could also check out one of the happy pear s cookbooks i think the second to most recent one is all about learning frameworks for cooking meals rather than specific recipes so you learn about what goes into each of the flavour profiles for a dish edit to add they are both vegan so all the recipes are vegan as well
gnje6up,Cooking,good suggestions here but ill also add bittmans how to cook everything vegetarian many of the recipes are full vegan of course
gnjvdhu,Cooking,i own it and found it very helpful as a vegetarian with some vegan tendencies definitely a decent amount of stuff i had to ignore as well but it really explained many principles i didnt understand before and taught some very foundational stuff
gnjdq24,Cooking,if you like the show the book is more of that energy with a lot more useful info hope you enjoy it
gnkfdpk,Cooking,its on sale for   on amazon if that helps
gnj0trp,Cooking,the book is leagues better than the show the show is like a taster for the book setting the mood the book is the actual science and techniques definitely worth it imho
gniw8cu,Cooking,check the copy right info in the front of the book on both itll tell you if its a different edition and which is more recent usually
gnjm2ly,Cooking,i bought the former i dont know anything about the latter flip through them and see which you like better perhaps
gnjiwwl,Cooking,bear in mind if youve been cooking for a few years its not going to revolutionize your cooking its geared towards beginners or people early in intermediary stages its a good book but the recipes are all straightforward and nothing too wild
gnjj5y0,Cooking,if you enjoyed the series then i definitely recommend the book more of the energy with a lot more actual information
gnkj897,Cooking,deleted
gniqcvi,Cooking,i just think its weird that people think she is humble bragging or self congratulating are we reading the same book
gnimfo0,Cooking,i mean really you can learn anything through experience given enough time and sticking to things you buy in a store read not poisonous you can learn everything in the book without using any resource of any kind the book is a starting off point a competent one its not targeted at people who already know what the book teaches
gnisond,Cooking,no you are correct its such an overrated book and tv series it doesnt deliver on its promise half as much as it sells itself as doing which is a pity as that would be revolutionary like others i would recommend food lab in its place for the same goal of explaining cooking in its universality
gnjh909,Cooking,why not ale is a standard in indian cuisine post british rule
gniuwdj,Cooking,as a general rule ounces are always fine because theyre a unit of weight   you just need to convert  oz is  ish g so     times you can just round up to  g the real problem comes when they start using units of volume for non liquid ingredients   cup of flour etc   us cup is about  ml if you want to convert to weight based measures you have to convert every cup based ingredient to a weight  and this changes by ingredient      cup of eggs is far heavier than   cup of flour your other option is to just use your measuring jug and eyeball it personally i always go the weight route i hate volume measures for large ingredient amounts unless that measure is the  only  measure you use for the recipe and the size is irrelevant to anything but the amount you cook comes down to preference really
gnkuelg,Cooking,you can buy it with metric measurements
gnl3l7t,Cooking,your comments has been removed for excessive spam self promotion outside links per rules   and   please post any self content in the weekly youtube content round up threat stickied to the top of the sub or reply to comments with a full recipe and or information rather than a link thanks
gnj4s35,Cooking,same here i read through the book and really enjoyed it tried to watch the series and didnt finish the first episode because of the lack of info if youre interested in the information and techniques i definitely recommend the book i personally learned a lot from it
gnj80c4,Cooking,so the show is promotional material very little if any of it is relevant to the book what the series does well is give you an idea of the mood of the book the tone of the show is the tone of the book but where the show is basically look at this place and food the book contains a ton of actual information my basic thing with the show is if you enjoyed it buy the book because itll be a nice read if you didnt like the show because it didnt teach much buy the book it has the stuff you expected to learn from the show if you didnt like the show because you didnt like her dont get the book because it is more of her edit  also im not a fan of olive oil either garlic and oil pasta is delicious but theres nothing else where olive oil is a primary flavor that i like it has its place in the cooking process to impart a very specific flavor but when its a highlight its invariably a negative experience for me and no its not that i havent acquired a taste ive been using it for years good stuff and fresh stuff and its just not my thing
gnixv8j,Cooking,i thought the series was a bit underwhelming the book is really good imo
gnkisx5,Cooking,perhaps the problem is that youve never had quality olive oil which is highly likely high quality olive oil is nothing like common olive oil in grocery stores purchase directly from a grower or reliable distributor  most of us are blissfully ignorant about how much rancid olive oil we use  https  fivethirtyeight com features most of us are blissfully ignorant about how much rancid olive oil we use   best olive oils reviewed by chefs   https  nymag com strategist article best olive oils according to chefs html
gnj3b9x,Cooking,how can one hate olive oil seems like its time to aquire a taste
gnjqgzq,Cooking,caramelization is the best
gnld8zf,Cooking,i treated this the same way i treat anything that brings me joy i try to spread it same reason i got my fighting game friends to try tfh same reason i got my friends playing hearthstone to try runeterra same reason i got my gf to watch ghibli films
gnjnwe0,Cooking,no i need to update the op i wouldnt recommend it for vegans generally
gnjhm6l,Cooking,i think thats more a fault of misplaced expectation than anything the book targets beginner cooks to give them a jumping off point is why i said ill recommend it specifically to new people as people who have been cooking for years wont get a ton out of it its still enjoyable if you liked the tone of the show but it is for people who need a foundation in order to get the full use of other cookbooks
gnk12al,Cooking,its heavy on animal products youll want to look for vegan specific cook books as its a niche style
gnjh7tu,Cooking,i respectfully disagree it should be called salt salt salt salt the author grossly oversalts everything you cant taste the food forgive me svauspicious its rare i get to call out pure bs none of her recipes tell you how much salt to use all of them either say pinch or just simply salt either a  youre full of it have read nothing and just hating for the sake of it most likely scenario b  you over salted the food yourself and blame the book for your mistake c  you watch people throw a ton of salt in without understanding that different salts have different levels of salty taste but regardless one thing i do know you are talking completely out your ass
gnjg0rv,Cooking,word of warning i prefer food labs overall style and layout more i think they re both great but i m glad i was gifted salt fat acid heat and didn t buy it myself i found there to be a lot of overlap in information food lab reminds me of a text book but i like that about it
gnketoc,Cooking,i gifted that book my little brother and sister dude is   years old and killing it using that book so proud of him when i was his age i felt like a gourmet chef using mccormic chili packets and pimping my chili with cheese and layering my frozen burritos with jalapenos and jarred taco sauce meanwhile my sister is supplying me with a steady stream of homemade ranch which i definitely am not mad about he recently made our mother a smashed burger and she said it was the best burger she ever had she had been chasing the taste of burgers we had at a hole in the wall restaurant while on vacation for years and baby bro found the holy grail for her he is starting to explore cuisines and recipes he never even considered i love how accessible kenji has made great amazing home cooking for novices and trained home cooks alike
gnjc46s,Cooking,ohhh thats a rough one stay strong
gnjfcen,Cooking,oh eesh i m sorry to hear i guess  lots of time to read then cook as soon as you re better covid is temporary but knowledge lasts forever you ll see it through
gnjtdvj,Cooking,i had covid in may took about   weeks to get any semblance of taste back then   months for it to be back to
gnnog14,Cooking,perfect time to practice won t mind the screwups
gnjff09,Cooking,both books plus a cast iron the world needs more friends like you
gnkp186,Cooking,the flavor equation is a very well written book but you really need to like indian food to enjoy the majority of recipes if you love indian flavors you will love the book though
gnjah6v,Cooking,i found salt to be the easier read i have the food lab but never finished it
gnjl0nm,Cooking,i recently saw it at costco for i think
gnjytiv,Cooking,check your local library i was able to place holds and then i get to drive in and pick them up outside super easy
gnjtajx,Cooking,if you dont mind  walmart  https  www walmart com ip the food lab better home cooking through science    i recently discovered they have pretty fantastic book prices
gnkqo5n,Cooking,also check your local bookstore i saw it in a smaller barnes   noble by me so you probably can find it
gnlj956,Cooking,here is a pdf   https  v mbj oliw pdcdn  xyz dl  phpid h d f bd c c f a u cache ext pdf n the food lab better home cooking through science  https  v mbj oliw pdcdn  xyz dl  phpid h d f bd c c f a u cache ext pdf n the food lab better home cooking through science
gnksmus,Cooking,it does  i mean it s in the name i think the lab it s going to be technical and existence based researched for sure it s different but i think it s what sets it apart and draws so many people to it
gnksgqk,Cooking,most his recipes he uses weight whenever possible only references  cups  or  teaspoons  when speaking roughly with room for adjustments anything that matters you ll see volume by weight and usually grams as for the language though sorry you very well may be right don t worry he s not going to ask you to measure your ingredients by bald eagle feathers or freedoms per hot dog you ll be ok ha
gnm4wlo,Cooking,his channel is amazing i look forward to every video it s a little embarrassing how many times he s put a video out in the morning that resulted in changed dinner plans that very evening
gnim4bh,Cooking,i m sorry but if making a joke about hitting your wife on the butt with a wooden spoon is  never ok and blatant misogyny  then i feel that term is entirely too watered down for continued use
gnijovd,Cooking,what do you mean
gniqsfb,Cooking,your sources are goodreads reviews do you also get your medical advice from yahoo answers please re evaluate your critical thinking skills and stop outsourcing them to lazy review sites
gnik5fw,Cooking,the author of the book is extremely left leaning and has called out misogyny and sexual harassment in professional kitchens multiple times even if that werent true i dont think saying a cookbook is misogynist without reading it is productive for anyone
gnilafz,Cooking,kenji ends his videos with guys gals and non binary pals i dont think hes very misogynistic
gnimmgw,Cooking,it does seem like you have an opinion and are eager to spread it considering youve pasted these same links in this thread multiple times i clicked through and read all three reviews and all they prove are that the people who wrote them cant recognize when things are said tongue in cheek if you watch any of kenjis videos as i do or follow him on instagram as i do youll know that hes far from misogynistic hell ive seen him go off on someone for their casual sexism in joking that kenji must be wearing his wifes mask after he posted a selfie in a pink mask in that case i actually thought kenji couldve chilled a bit and just let the joke slide but does that sound like a misogynist to you kenji isnt perfect as none of us are but he makes some damn good food and puts a ton of research and effort into his work its a shame you let a few strangers reviews stop you from checking out such a highly regarded and useful book
gnillte,Cooking,ive never seen anything misogynistic in the food lab thats strange in fact i know the author is a very far left person based on comments that hes made on reddit and other social media
gnj7djd,Cooking,if you can t step back from your other experiences of him and see that a lot of these quotes don t belong in this book particularly if he is who you want him to be i don t know what to tell you you could very well reverse this and apply it to your  rd hand out of context opinion you cant just rip a quote from somewhere and then go tarnish a person that you admittedly have zero experience with why dont you waste all this time and energy that you seem to have spreading this shit on people who actually deserve it this insane witch hunting of people in your own ranks is some of the dumbest shit the professionally offended seem to do
gnj4bqi,Cooking,i m offended give me a break i read all   above reviews these people all go around looking for reasons everything they complain about is fine the guy is normal they just need lives
gnj4gs5,Cooking,i m gonna go against the flow here and thank you for posting these it s not ridiculous to be offput by comments and attitudes like these or to want a cookbook where you don t have to make a cognitive effort to ignore offputting things
gnkf9o3,Cooking,goodreads reviews aren t critics are you for real any unstable eternally offended person can write a review there sfah stans are just big mad that kenji is a better chef not to mention sfah is illustrated like a children s book big cringe
gnk4vo7,Cooking,try recipe club by david chang very silly but educational
gnlnjd8,Cooking,im with you my dad used this book all the time when i was growing up it was also the first cookbook he got me after i moved out since then ive gifted him all sorts of weird cookbooks that dont compare he has loved the food lab and flour water salt yeast so ive done something kinda right
gnj58ag,Cooking,the joy of cooking forty humans
gnkbqgt,Cooking,grays joy of cooking
gnjatg0,Cooking,mostly theory the entire second half is recipes the opposite of theory
gnj9754,Cooking,brilliant thats a really helpful response thank you
gnktcfv,Cooking,haha i was literally about to comment isnt masterchef pretty chill forgot countries other than australia have it
gnl9eb7,Cooking,that seems like a straight up stupid thing to imply if so
gnk0okz,Cooking,is that really implied in the book thats a surprisingly bad take youre tasting them whether a dish explicitly calls for them or not
gnlfopt,Cooking,haha yes thank you for finishing my thought for me i shouldn t reddit when i m barely awake
gnkvdu1,Cooking,i really enjoyed it as someone with zero cooking fundamentals like it had a huge impact on my cooking just through the fact that i now understand fat is flavour and i ve been perpetually under salting everything
gnim1ki,Cooking,agreed on all counts and to go even further i find many recipes too meat poultry focused i eat fish and only very rarely meat and i find myself not being able or wanting to cook half of the recipes when she explains a non meat version of a dish it has very little detail and overall the recipes in which vegetables are the main ingredient are a bit meh
gnjm3t4,Cooking,i would recommend where cooking begins by carla lalli music easy to follow you learn ingredient swaps and it teaches you how one technique can be applied to different foods
gniraq9,Cooking,this is why i prefer anything put out by taste of home they put out magazines on certain topics chicken casseroles  x  they have some great cookbooks and even put out huge binders already with tabs in it so you can flip to different sections to find recipes most recipes don t require crazy ingredients
gninrug,Cooking,do agree just finished first half of the book and one thing i do not like is that she thinks everyone knows which are the tastes of every kichen in world i don t know for example indian kichen and how it tastes so maybe she should add little description what are some main caracteristics of each kichen and then i could use here wheel
gnkoae4,Cooking,the ground breaking part of this book is the first instructional half not the recipes  salt fat acid heat  has transformed how i cook but i dont think ive made even one of her recipes
gnj2ivy,Cooking,she bizarrely imho seems to be rather a divisive figure i loved her book and netflix series for its earnestness in tone and enthusiastic curiosity but apparently people find that grating and egotistical
gnjixmz,Cooking,yeah i remember the dough anecdote and it was used as an example of how the order of when you put in the ingredients wasn t important i think she goes on to talk about the chemical properties of gluten and why her dough turned out ok very very weird to interpret  i thought i fucked up the dough but it actually turned out ok because i was able to fix it  as  self congratulatory
gnj2zvb,Cooking,hey i actually like her and the book but she  is  very self congratulatory like girl you dont have to name drop the same resturant   times in a   page book we get it you cut your teeth in an acclaimed resturant like giada de laurentiis doesnt have to mention her five star culinary school  constantly  neither does gordon samin is constantly congratulating herself for being an amazing chef  now  her anecdote about the polenta was about her first starting out and it is actually self congratulatory in that it leads to a and now i know how to salt and i samin would never ever make that mistake again maybe its insecurity or a need for reassurance but samin really does have this need for validation that is indisputable book is amazing though and really worth reading i think some people are overblowing her unlikableness i find her very relatable and kind but yeah her one negative trait is that self congratulations need for validation but no one is perfect and there are much worse chefs out there to be focusing on her one negative trait so badly
gnju2iy,Cooking,very great way of putting it there is a huge difference in perspective in the two things you said and honesty that change in perspective has changed my life at large and my cooking life one of those lessons to take out of the kitchen with you great comments
gnj5d0w,Cooking,a lot of what chez panisse did starting in the  s was pretty innovative for restaurants in america their whole approach with seasonal high quality ingredients and certain techniques was far from the norm in restaurants and they were a huge contributor to california cuisine and fine dining i mean   years later the fact that it seems so minuscule is just a testament to how influential the place was
gnix8rd,Cooking,yeah i really didnt pick up on this part of its appeal for me was her relaxed and self deprecating manner shes worth ten gordon ramsays in my opinion
gnjrj6d,Cooking,theres very little of the actual science in it besides salt your meat and use more fat acid or any recipes actually which i would tend to expect from a cooking show i think this was the biggest let down for me for a show called salt fat acid heat i really wanted to learn about how they work and why they are such important parts of cooking that didnt really come across to me it was mostly look at me cooking in this cool place using this one ingredient shes a very charming host and the show was well produced but the content itself was lacking i realize that not everyone is looking for a science lesson from their cooking books shows though
gnjdptd,Cooking,theres very little of the actual science in it why would that be a negative the overwhelming vast majority of cookbooks are not written from a science perspective
gnjbjqy,Cooking,shell be   next month graduated from college last year hope youre right
gnioay0,Cooking,yeah dude ess if youre converting from one medium to another and theres a better way to do it in the latter it seems like you should try to put out the best product
gnjnjm5,Cooking,i met the author about   years ago in new orleans she is a remarkable woman
gnimcj1,Cooking,mmm makes sense i m very new to cooking and feel i don t have the basics down yet so i prob won t need too many techniques or i ll just get more confused
gnit56h,Cooking,thank you so much
gnn80c4,Cooking,flavour is a fantastic veggie book
gnilydq,Cooking,ah i see thanks
gnim2w5,Cooking,oof don t have netflix maybe i rlly should get one soon
gnkie5f,Cooking,how sweet of you to share that info something to consider and very tempting
gnj6i24,Cooking,good that is what i was expecting from the show and then after   hours i was left with watching her visiting some countries and eating food good deal for her not so much for me
gnjjp8o,Cooking,cool i appreciate that i did not expect it to be for beginners given her background that being said it is always nice to brush up and might be a solid cookbook for my wife and daughter thanks
gnkjc7s,Cooking,i think someone didnt like their comments being linked to all of those comments are removed
gnjgdg3,Cooking,its okay when gordon ramsay talks about his accomplishments but when she does it nah its way over the line
gnir62f,Cooking,from the introduction  you can become not only a good cook but a great one i know because it happened to me
gnj30iz,Cooking,while parts were interesting i think the tv series for salt fat acid heat was quite bad chef nosrat just falls flat at entertaining compared to other travel or food hosts and imho talked about herself far more than the other interesting things going on every episode felt like a rushed bill nye explaination of why x works in food nosrat talking about her childhood influencing how great of a cook she is for the millionth time introduction to some cool micro process some lady is using from a     year old technique to make authentic something that is immediately cut short to go back to chef telling us how to make a   ingredient dish using a generic store bought version of that cool thing from the process we will never hear about again meanwhile kenji is out on his channel like watch me make scrambled eggs and pet my dog   oh and here are techniques ive learned if you care at all e  i still watched the series and purchased sfah after the fact id still rank food lab as a more useful resource for recipes and technique overall if i had to pick one
gnjhxc8,Cooking,is it in what
gniwizd,Cooking,well yeah i know i can convert most measurements my experience though is that i just dont bother cooking the recipe instead and just make one with correct measurements thats why i wondered about how prevalent the measurements in this book i know my mileage from it will be a lot lower if the recipes in it are with us measurements
gnl4s8o,Cooking,have had troubles finding it in stores in my country any way to see it beforehand when ordering online
gnkamhd,Cooking,this whole side thread about liking the book but feeling the show lacked substance has un soured me on buying the book i never bought it because i watched the series and based on that assumed the book would follow the same kind of  science adjacent travel channel cooking show  vibe
gnj8jeu,Cooking,omg thank you both for the answer about the show and olive oil glad to know im not the only one
gnj5hqp,Cooking,i dont like olives and i dont like very oily things definitely cant see why a lot of people call it liquid gold
gnkiyo0,Cooking,because most people have never tasted high quality olive oil you have to seek it out   most of us are blissfully ignorant about how much rancid olive oil we use  https  fivethirtyeight com features most of us are blissfully ignorant about how much rancid olive oil we use
gnjoz6w,Cooking,aw what a shame   thank you so much for replying though
gnkor8a,Cooking,thanks for letting me know
gnjn0if,Cooking,answer is d i watched the accompanying youtube video and observed the huge amount of salt the author uses the video is free i suggest you watch before you leap to her defense
gnjg43r,Cooking,good to know thanks for the tip
gnjpd33,Cooking,which one has more info on the whys and the reasons for different techniques and doing certain things a certain way with certain ingredients i feel like that s much more useful than just following recipes
gnk2frm,Cooking,if you like a textbook like cookbook check out  on food and cooking  if you haven t already
gnlgao3,Cooking,ya sfah is a very narrative driven and totally different style of cookbook cookbooks can be many things and i celebrate that
gnkrxde,Cooking,yes the recipes are definitely less culturally diverse than in sfah and the food lab but it turned me on to many new indian and middle eastern tastes that is a good point though i wouldn t recommend the book to anyone who doesn t like indian food
gnjfxna,Cooking,yeah  they re written in different styles honestly sometimes i ll just pick one up or the other and just flip through till something catches my eye some days my brain just syncs more with food lab some with salt i never know what will sound good at a given time i recommend filling your world with food kitchen literature and letting your mood decide in the moment
gnjl2qe,Cooking,hmm i do need to go up and renew my membership
gnl5q5c,Cooking,just commenting to say that i m happy to see a plug for libraries   that said after you ve checked out sfah   food lab from your local library and have some bread saved up buy both
gnljwuz,Cooking,while i appreciate this i want kenji to benefit from a sale
gnku8kk,Cooking,what i like about  sfah  is that it is cooking first i think its no coincidence that samin nosrat is a woman with a career in the kitchen to me  the food lab  like  ratio  and a lot of other books written coincidentally by men feel very nerdy very theory first they provide vastly more theoretical knowledge than any practical cook would ever need yes these information dense books could be enriching for an experienced cook but they are terribly intimidating for a beginner which is the context of the original post
gnipgft,Cooking,i shouldnt say this but one time i couldnt resist using a wooden spoon to slap my girlfriend on the bum and she found out something about herself right there in the kitchen xd it has awakened something
gnj8alf,Cooking,i feel like of thats all you took from the review you were trying very hard to not understand her point given the several other examples of questionable humor embedded in the whole gendered history of cooking which the reviewers lays out quite well
gniv8zl,Cooking,he actually writes spouse   so he might be gay which would make it fine for that awful feminist s and it is now mysogyny to think that your mum overcooks things   what a repugnant divisive review from a very sensitive misandrist not she claims cooking is a female domain and all sorts of gender biased comments far more than the author
gnil2w9,Cooking,https  www goodreads com review show   https  www goodreads com review show   https  www goodreads com review show
gniygpc,Cooking,yahoo nah prolly bing
gniz5ru,Cooking,i haven t read it so have no opinion thats as far as i got with their bs claim lol
gnil2o9,Cooking,https  www goodreads com review show   https  www goodreads com review show   https  www goodreads com review show
gnilbre,Cooking,just responding to the quotes in the book
gniosh7,Cooking,i was asked for more information twice i gave it to the people that asked for it and edited my original answer with the sources so i wouldn t be asked again i think you ve attributed things to my actions that aren t there
gnj4pmy,Cooking,you can be a  far left  person and still occasionally perpetuate ideas that are offputting and uncomfortable it s not ridiculous to want a cookbook where you don t have to put in the cognitive effort to ignore things like the word  midget  or hiding chicken from his wife or whatever it s tiring
gnj7t4z,Cooking,if a cookbook from serious eats requires too much cognitive effort to ignore off putting things i seriously recommend therapy to handle real world issues youre grasping at straws over goodreads book reviews and only allowing it to suit your own narrative instead of ya know reading the book for yourself do you also get your medical advice from yahoo answers i dont know if you even read those reviews let alone the book but theyre laughably bad and provide zero substance ive actually read the book cover to cover and can confirm that there are no ridiculous misogynistic statements like those reviews claim i fully support people not wanting to buy books with shitty sexist jokes and whatnot but people taking offense at cheekily swatting your partner with a spoon should really stick to kids cook books if they cant handle a joke found in adult level reading material
gnk5f58,Cooking,thanks for the recommendation ill check it out i love his show ugly delicious
gnmpgve,Cooking,i love recipe club it s a good laugh plus i learn a lot too on my list to make is those danish pork patties and the banana fritters
gnj9g4f,Cooking,the joy of cooking for forty humans
gnjb3ii,Cooking,not useful recipes her recipes are designed to practice elements of the theory if that book suits your style then go for it but those recipes arent my style just having a conversation
gnlztw6,Cooking,im in canada but its the only one i watch last season was so amazing with new judges returning favourites and a damn pandemic to contend with
gnl3hf4,Cooking,yea the info it provided was great i just found its delivery to be boring and felt kind she was pretty awkward not taking away from her knowledge given how acclaimed her book is
gnimcj7,Cooking,is there a book out there with intent but geared for more plant based diets i m vegan but i ll take a vegetarian focused book as these principles obviously still apply
gnj2aq2,Cooking,i understand your frustration but that really isnt her fault she wrote the book for the   of people who are poultry and meat focused
gnjsmpk,Cooking,i do agree with this hard but im used to it
gnjdftk,Cooking,youre judging a cookbook based on your own restricted diet this manual transmission sucks really hard to steer and change gears with only   arm
gnjjegw,Cooking,bowls of goodness by nina olsson has some seriously delish vegetarian and vegan food the buddha bowl and royal korma are amazing
gnjjhwf,Cooking,i bought this book about cooking but it didn t suit my exact dietary preferences  that is not the author s fault that is your fault for choosing the wrong book
gnmwvq2,Cooking,ok i ve looked into this book and it looks like a solid recommendation thanks
gnj2h7z,Cooking,i find taste of home to be much plainer and geared twords what would be a stereotypical midwesterner palate i prefer dishes with much more flavor which naturally means more ingredients
gnk3tv0,Cooking,just fyi  cuisine describes a style of food for example indian cuisine kitchen is the room you cook in these are two english words that mean the same thing in different languages but different things in english english is silly like that
gnjl4pg,Cooking,kind of shocking watching the netflix show reading the book and experiencing her on other videos and podcasts i can t imagine how anyone could have a negative perception she s just super fucking charismatic respectful of different food cultures and very well educated on seemingly anything she comments on despite this i never get a pretentious tone from her at all if anything she gives off a very down to earth vibe despite her obvious qualifications and expertise i was already a good enough home cook before reading sfah but that book was an absolute game changer for me it s not only changed my understanding but also my habits and how i think of anything i m preparing
gnj9q4h,Cooking,reddit always hates this take but her gender and race are huge factors in this imo
gnk0k1q,Cooking,i have no idea how people find samin egotistical listening to her podcast home cooking she comes off as humble and down to earth and just really really passionate about food
gnj4xv3,Cooking,i gotta wonder how  self congratulatory  you would find her if she were a man tbh
gnjdx7m,Cooking,remember when alice waters went on television and railed against climate change then proceeded to cook a single egg in a spoon over a raging fire then told poor people the price of food needs to increase and that maybe not buy that iphone and buy organic vegetables instead
gnixnm5,Cooking,definitely agree with you its kinda crazy to see so many people think that shes self congratulating herself its kind of wild makes me think there must be something else at play like
gnjoml4,Cooking,lol imagine comparing this flash in the pan hack to gordon ramsay her show book was literally nothing groundbreaking or new alton brown was doing the exact same thing and better twenty years ago and he managed to talk about the science of food without being pretentious oh wow using open flame seasoning properly and using acid to cut through fatty flavors so revolutionary nobody has ever thought of that before this review sums up perfectly what this show was actually about    its a beautiful series not just about food but about culture and experience and tradition with a very heavy and notable focus on women and people of color throughout the world yeah i ll stick to shows cookbooks that actually focus on cooking not about how virtuous the chef is nobody knew who this woman was before netflix decided she was their poc of the week
gnjup2j,Cooking,the book is super approachable and taught me more ab these things than i ever knew as an already decent new orleans home cook ive never seen the show but i think its mostly to help sell the book and you cant expect it to deliver as much information as shows never do definitely valid criticism of the show but i think also to be expected
gnjchgl,Cooking,id say it was a good   years after i got out of college when i moved out of tangentially related jobs and into work in my field hold the book and maybe try again in a few years lol
gnjvsbi,Cooking,i started at   and am hardcore into it now i have a few friends that were later even
gnkbxqq,Cooking,my interest and abilities in cooking improved a lot over my  s ive always loved food but cooking isnt really just about loving food its really more about developing a sustainable routine of meal planning and shopping now im   and considered the best cook in my friend group which has a lot of good cooks
gnj6gu1,Cooking,the proper term is  dudette   come on man it s
gnk2pdu,Cooking,if you are looking for ottolenghi start with plenty we have for of his books and that is the best and its vego
gnjkwwn,Cooking,i think it was intended to fill a gap in the learning stage or answer questions about how why things work if you watched the show and enjoyed it its worth the read regardless
gnjlb10,Cooking,rather different level of accomplishment and people dont like him for it either
gnjln35,Cooking,does he do that a lot i ve watched quite a bit of his content and don t recall hearing him talk about his accomplishments that frequently
gnirfea,Cooking,thats like saying if i can do it anyone can do it how is that a giant flex if anything thats like shitting on yourself
gnj3rfp,Cooking,thanks this is sort of along the lines of the point i was trying to make but im done trying to argue about a book i dont even like
gnjly3v,Cooking,kenji and alton are my favorites because they explain things simply and don t always encourage you to use crazy or rare ingredients alton idk as much these days but on the old good eats is what i m thinking of if i m looking for a technique or something i always look for serious eats or food lab articles or videos first
gnjn00v,Cooking,disclaimer i am not indian i am not an expert in indian cuisine however i am an expert in food and the preparation of it so what i know is   flour binder in nan deglaze in masalla and curry and baste in roasted meats as well as prawn batter please feel free to correct me if you feel i am wrong fellow redditor and also i believe it bears repeating that these are all post colonial uses as i understand from my next door neighbor who is indian and owns an indian restaurant right next to my creole restaurant
gniwwae,Cooking,ah fair enough my apologies i blame monday brain  p
gnmjby6,Cooking,im not sure i bought it from amazon uk at the time it should say in the description
gnjakv3,Cooking,i will say if you havent yet try garlic and oil pasta binging with babbishs video on it is great while yes the olive oil is a primary component the ingredients in the dish really do come together to make something great
gnj5sms,Cooking,removed
gnkqs2z,Cooking,yes i knows
gnjne2j,Cooking,so to be clear youve neither tasted nor made literally anything and assume the food you find is salty because you watched a video of someone using the amount of salt they liked completely ignoring the bit that every recipe is salt to your taste and the only way to make the dish too salty is by your own hand this is childish still talking entirely out your ass
gnjvhy1,Cooking,you can t taste the food  for food you ve never tasted what are you even talking about and if you think she uses too much salt despite never tasting it just use less salt there easy
gnjptcf,Cooking,imo food lab the other does a great job explaining too but it seems more geared toward people who aren t as proficient in the kitchen food lab can help those people too but it s way more information heavy almost unnecessarily so at times that s what i love about kenji though i m probably going to give my gf salt fat acid heat because she is starting from the bottom she understands food lab too but the information isn t as powerful if you don t have any experience with what food lab is talking about at least in my opinion edit  food lab has actual photos too as opposed to illustrations in the other book
gnkpnw0,Cooking,i have both and i love both if i had to come up with a good way to describe the difference between them it would be that food lab is a book for the science of cooking and salt fat acid heat is for the art both are accurate ways to approach cooking but its all about the style and the way you approach cooking yourself if youre all about improvisation figuring stuff out playing around with it going by feel rather than measurement   youll vibe with samin if youre feeling more about the technical bits of why then youll vibe with kenji  x b  yes i refer to them by their first names yes its extra yes i read them both all the time  p
gnls0rw,Cooking,i really wish i liked it better it s such a well written book but i just don t care for most indian food no matter how hard i try
gnm4bap,Cooking,order from powell s books online i picked up a copy there for a fraction of what others are paying
gniysco,Cooking,looool i was gonna say  this person is really gonna say  you cannot joke about spanking your wife ever  my wife thinks you re lameeeeeee
gniyo5z,Cooking,your post made me laugh at loud thanks for sharing a beautiful moment
gnju09w,Cooking,they literally said that was never ok i m sorry but don t include that with your  super serious  examples if you want to be taken seriously if all the reviews reference the same   examples in an almost   page book then i think the guy that is very outspokenly left leaning and purposefully includes gender neutral terminology in his speech is probably not a massive misogynist they also point out that bringing science in to cooking is a way to remove women from cooking so i m going to say they don t have much of a point and were to trying to shotgun any accusation out there that they can
gnj6m4l,Cooking,kenji has a wife and spouse is a gender neutral term which makes the review and accusarion of sexism even more stupid cause these people dont even have basic reading comprehension
gnimd0g,Cooking,my first big warning sign was his blatant pervasive misogyny just about every other page he makes some crack about his wife or his mom which range from mild  i realize now that dislike of vegetables is entirely my mother s fault sorry to break it to you ma   to incredibly offensive  whether stirring sauces tasting soups or gently whacking cheeky spouses who disturb you in the kitchen a wooden spoon is the tool you ll want   percent of the time   i m sorry but you cannot joke about spanking your wife ever im sorry what this is misogynistic joking about your mom ruining vegetables and gently whacking cheeky spouses playing around with my spouse and smacking their butt gender never specified btw is misogynistic then i guess im one hell of a misogynist and so is my wife
gniu8pz,Cooking,no offence but making assumptions based on other peoples conclusions is lazy and immature read the cookbook decide for yourself looking at comments made by people who judging by their reviews are not even able to boil an egg is while entertaining a complete waste of time
gnj28jq,Cooking,youre responding to other peoples opinions about the boom not context from the actual book huge difference
gnipffl,Cooking,well stop that lmao
gnisq5a,Cooking,only one of those people asked for more information  it did come across like you had an agenda as you yourself have established youre unfamiliar with kenji and his background beliefs personality so a bunch of people who  are  familiar with him are providing their informed opinions with a lot more knowledge of the matter at hand its fine if you still dont want to read kenjis book or have anything to do with him i really dont care but it sure does seem like you have a weird agenda against someone whom you purport to know next to nothing about of course ive only reached this conclusion based on reading a few things you said
gnir8p1,Cooking,did you read what that lady had written and think ah yes thats something that sounds as though it has come a completely stable and sane person have you not questioned those reviews
gnj9pak,Cooking,okay the midget thing i get and honestly i feel like kenji would likely remove that from the second revision if he was asked but the hiding chicken from his wife im assuming you havent havent read the food lab but its clearly in good natured jest and written as a joke between two loving individuals and not as the ugh my  god damn wife  has no self control boomer humor sort of thing you might be expecting
gnjiayk,Cooking,thank you you are the first person i ve seen to be bothered by that it s made me hate the book
gnk6s9d,Cooking,i recommend starting at the beginning with his thanksgiving episodes there are a lot of silly inside jokes about david chang being a terrible rule follower that get established during those episodes plus its really funny listening to three people of color who like myself didnt grow up with a traditional american thanksgiving dinner but have to construct one for the show hahaha
gnjuy5m,Cooking,i cooked fitty men
gnjbqle,Cooking,i mean im also trying to have a conversation im just trying to understand your point of view what about the recipes arent useful what is it lacking
gnipfni,Cooking,https  www goodreads com book show   how to cook everything vegetarian mark bittman this book turned me into our household s primary cook
gninlcm,Cooking,you should try thug kitchen not really about the science behind cooking but an excellent and varied set of recipes that are all vegan vegetarian easy to get into even if you eat meat but want less of it
gnjgihk,Cooking,i recently got vegan fo everybody by america s test kitchen and it s got a lot of great info about how to cool with plant based ingredients in terms of how to select them and why there s also a bunch of recipes in it highly recommend
gnio17g,Cooking,if you find one please let me know or cooking youtubers for that matter all the ones i found were either not very entertaining not focused or cooking science or use too many inaccessible ingredients
gnl0ll3,Cooking,six seasons  a new way with vegetables by joshua mcfadden is incredible i think there are some meat recipes in there but the book is broken down by seasons with vegetables being the main focus and it s super informative and educational about the whole process of cooking
gnj5nwv,Cooking,yes and i dont blame her for it really i understand that and wouldnt want her to take it away just wish there was a bit more on the non meat poultry stuff the book is long big so a bit longer wouldnt be so bad
gnjo5k1,Cooking,i dont think its  that  unreasonable to expect a book that markets itself as a meta cookbook heavily implying   or even outright stating   that what it teaches is applicable to a wide variety of dishes to be as versatile as advertised and i say that as a vegetarian who read and reasonably enjoyed it
gnkn2ps,Cooking,i addressed that in another comment i do not have a  strict  restricted diet i just choose to eat less meat and i like having lots of different cookbooks and taking a bit from each there are great things in this book but there are others areas in which personally i think its lacking i think u cachebandicoot has explained it well
gnl95ar,Cooking,person not solely living off meats   manual transmission being steered in reverse with one arm guzzling meat is a phenomenon of contemporary western life not the well balanced way weve traditionally eaten
gnjjlpb,Cooking,oh thanks for the tips i will look into those
gnjkeyk,Cooking,excuse me oof i should reconsider my book shopping choices nope not the authors fault i agree but i dont think i chose the wrong book either im happy to have cookbooks on lots of different things take a bit from here and there and i did enjoy the first part of this book i dont have strict dietary restrictions or preferences but i think its fair enough to point out things you dont like as much in a book i think the author of any book understands they will never please anyone or never write the perfect book the same way that a reader should understand not everything in a book will be of their liking as is fair to point out that in my opinion the book misses out on a few things but hey thats my opinion not to everyones liking im sure
gnjjdoc,Cooking,thats a pretty ignorant comment the best cooks are the one that can extract tons of flavor out of a few ingredients its not always just about throwing a ton of spices on something
gnk42o0,Cooking,got it thx
gnl9864,Cooking,thats super weird assuming its some americanism
gnl1dme,Cooking,ive met her in person volunteered at a cooking class ft her and she was the most gracious down to earth bubbly person ever like what you see on the show is really her she offered to give me her free cookbook which i had already purchased ahead of time as a thank you for being there
gnm6cp9,Cooking,racism and or sexism im not usually one to jump right to those for an explanation but in her case i think the most prominent thing one could dislike about her is her foreign sounding name and brown skin
gnlzb30,Cooking,i just finished reading the book two weeks ago i also am a good home cook my approach to salt and acid is so much more nuanced now my salads taste better i have also always found her podcasts and youtube videos charming
gnjpc84,Cooking,truth guarantee that if a dude wrote it some people would think he was cocky but more people would just appreciate that the guy had that much confidence in his cooking that or people dont read many cookbooks or cooking guides id say the majority ive read are full of the author talking themselves up and throwing in anecdotes where their dish was a huge hit at the big restaurant they worked at
gnkrgau,Cooking,there was a guy on one of these types of posts a while back saying how irritating she was for mentioning chez panisse all the time first of all if i ever worked as a freaking janitor for chez panisse id never stop talking about it second she clearly learned most of her fundamental cooking skills there and so obviously has to reference it when talking about her learning process idk just seems like if a woman wants to talk about her career she has to imply that shes terrible the whole time or people think shes bragging
gnju5iu,Cooking,its pretty well known that most people assume male chefs are assholes isnt it
gnj52go,Cooking,removed
gnjkfs2,Cooking,probably the same wild that you know nothing about this person and just assume they re sexist
gnjpirx,Cooking,did you just assume their gender
gnjfa7g,Cooking,so what she s a chef not a climate expert or economist if you want to pay attention to her for her non chef views go ahead  but that has little to do with her cooking ability or influence on the food world
gnj530x,Cooking,i really wonder if these people would feel the same way about her  ego  if she were a man
gnj3521,Cooking,i think most tv chefs come across as rather self congratulating  i dont think theres anything else at play beyond that
gnj2qw8,Cooking,hey i actually like her and the book but she  is  very self congratulatory like girl you dont have to name drop the same resturant   times in a   page book we get it you cut your teeth in an acclaimed resturant like giada de laurentiis doesnt have to mention her five star culinary school  constantly  neither does gordon maybe its insecurity or a need for reassurance but samin really does have this need for validation that is indisputable book is amazing though and really worth reading
gnk63ak,Cooking,so glad to see this i just worry about her health is all
gnjkkgl,Cooking,a wise man once said im a dude hes a dude shes a dude were all dudes
gnjn5x8,Cooking,people dont like him for it either i disagree with that otherwise he wouldnt have had multiple series watched by millions of people who watched it  specifically to watch him talk down to sub par cooks and restaurant owners  i mean maybe  you  dont like that shtick but you cant say people dont like him for it hell i saw his tiktok review video yesterday and he might as well have just whipped it out while he was yelling
gnjmk9l,Cooking,i love gordon ramsay but hes got a huge set of bollocks and hes never afraid to act like the expert he is and assert his success in the industry and that makes sense because hes had like four series now in which he is asked to help struggling restaurant hotel owners so damn right he should assert his expertise
gnisc47,Cooking,yes anyone can just get hired on the spot by a high end restaurant and crawl their way up the book is full of opportunities none of us will ever have yet the knowledge gained through these opportunities is like the op said completely obtainable in your own kitchen thats why it feels like a flex
gnjmugn,Cooking,i completely agree good eats molded me as a person and got me into cooking then again i am a scientist so the approach appeals to me much more because i do not accept things as dogma without seeing the evidence looking at you overly perpetuated myths like rest steak until it reaches room temp or only flip once on the grill
gnjd048,Cooking,do you know of something similar in spirit that doesnt use pasta im avoiding gluten to manage my digestive issues and i can say for a fact there are no decent gluten free pastas where i live ive tried them all and theyre like   of the satisfaction you get from regular pasta at best no amount of garlic can improve that  d
gnj8dj9,Cooking,i just dont like the taste i prefer neutral oils for frying and even salads i do like using sesame oil as flavouring for example so its not like im a complete novice to using various oils i have tried using flavoured olive oil like one thats flavoured with chili or lemon zest but i still find the olive oil flavour way too overwhelming and strong even when added in miniscule amounts i also hate the mouthfeel of avocados because they feel way too rich on the palate anyhow this comment was about the fat episode of the salt fat acid heat netflix series and i do find it very useless in the sense that its all about olive oil and if you dont like it then it tells very little about how important fat is in cooking
gnjvz2d,Cooking,arent you polite
gnjq21c,Cooking,awesome thanks for that suggestion i love kenji s materials and can t think of a better way to support him and a better source of his materials than buying his book
gnkpdlv,Cooking,thank you so much  about to buy
gnm4zmp,Cooking,i will on my next thanks i ve given away my own copy so many times i think i ve bought it   times over good to know
gnio4rr,Cooking,dude the lady who wrote this is nuts
gnivcms,Cooking,spouse   not even wife but lets all assume he hates all woman because i cant cook a boiled egg according to this  mans  directions
gninp84,Cooking,i think their criticisms are a bit overblown but those type of stereotypical jokes are certainly reminiscent of old mysogynistic views of the world arguably fits under boomer humour
gnippgo,Cooking,i do seem to be getting downvoted quite a lot for it
gnirb8p,Cooking,she was the least convincing the other two used quotes directly from the book
gnisqsa,Cooking,this is a very good comprehensive cookbook that i often turn to for recipes ratios cooking techniques but sfah i sat down and read cover to cover mark bittman is way friendlier to substitutions and modifications and vegetarians
gnj2y9c,Cooking,just throwing this out there  the books may be hard to find since they switched their name after some backlash to bad manners  their website  https  www badmanners com recipes is a really good resource for recipes at the current time but can agree on that brand have all three books and have cooked multiple things out of all three and have only stumbled upon   bad recipes
gniw4gn,Cooking,yes i second this i got it from a friend and love the recipes edit  there are a few thug kitchen books my friend got me the   tk  book which has mostly california inspired recipes im in europe and have no problem finding ingredients its fully plant based
gnizw3g,Cooking,try  nats what i reckon  https  youtu be sw ze ziafm plenty entertaining and ingredients are super easy to find
gnj5olv,Cooking,removed
gnmj1op,Cooking,some recipes are less flavorful than others all things being equal
gnktds6,Cooking,if a woman wants to talk about her career she has to imply that shes terrible the whole time or people think shes bragging exactly women are expected to be modest and downplay their efforts in the workplace when men show pride and confidence in their work theyre admired and congratulated when women show the same pride and confidence in their work theyre viewed as arrogant and bossy ive heard thats a huge issue in the restaurant industry and i certainly know its true in my field too biology research samin got to work somewhere incredible and learned a lot there she has every right to bring it up and be proud
gnj5gfk,Cooking,i did read that i m not implying that you think all women or  females  as you so beautifully put it lol are self congratulatory merely that in this particular case i wonder if you might respond to samin differently were she not a woman her projected confidence isn t more intense than kenji s or brad from ba s or many other men who are popular in food
gnjocqk,Cooking,why are you so quick to deny sexism when its a largely documented phenomenon
gnjk0ad,Cooking,her cooking ability you mean jerimiah towers
gnjnij1,Cooking,ding ding ding
gnj5gkm,Cooking,removed
gnjmr2u,Cooking,i wonder if all the people calling mysogony would feel the same regardless of what was being criticised about the book
gnj4jsr,Cooking,i guess so but i see that as being the nature of the genre rather than revealing anything about their actual personality like when they taste the dishes theyve just shown you how to make they cant be like thats fine they obviously need to gush a bit over how great it tastes presumably they dont coo over everything they make in their actual lives
gnjoje6,Cooking,are you one of those people that think people should humble to a fault cause thats actually like a form of deception
gnkbys4,Cooking,a wise  man dude once said im a dude hes a dude shes a dude were all dudes
gnjnw8i,Cooking,i can say people dont like him for it because i know multiple people who dont like him for it and regularly see it bought up in discussions on social media im not saying all people dont like him for it but there is no reason to assume as you seem to be doing that anyone being critical of this books author wouldnt be equally critical of him
gnj37zb,Cooking,you honestly are just coming across as mega jealous and kind of pressed by her like you hatred is because the high end resturant hired her and not you
gnitm8q,Cooking,the author doesnt think anyone can get a job at a high end restaurant youre making crazy assumptions the knowledge she has is attainable without working at high end restaurants thinking that this knowledge is only attainable at high end restaurants is elitist
gnjn1d2,Cooking,the steak thing is talked about quite a bit in serious eats article about pan searing steaks i flip my steak every   seconds and get an incredible crust don t care
gnjdne8,Cooking,unfortunately no i dont see the dish working without pasta and i cant recommend anything else to someone that doesnt like the flavor of olive oil id just bookmark the recipe if you ever go back to gluten
gnj8krq,Cooking,but you just admited you hate the mouthfeel of rich fat so wouldnt the whole section be lost
gnk2nm8,Cooking,you get what you give
gnlr8p1,Cooking,the food lab is nice extension of kenjis work on serious eats bringing the scientific method to the kitchen as an engineer who loves to cook it is gold
gniscri,Cooking,id say jestful spanking teasing tickling etc is a key ingredient in healthy relationships as long as both parties are doing it thinking of it as misogynistic tells me that this reviewer has a very narrow world view
gnip8ut,Cooking,boomer humor sounds about right but as far as boomer humor goes the jokes in the food lab are pretty much harmless at worst they get an eye roll from me before i keep reading
gniqclw,Cooking,because your  explanation  is shite
gnj92qy,Cooking,because youre making a ridiculous and harmful accusation on an author based on a review with contextless quotes when you havent read the book yourself instead of backing down and saying you may have gotten the wrong impression you continue to assert this like seriously the evidence of misogyny are him joking about having to hide fried chicken from his wife and a quote about smacking spouses that try to mess up your cooking with a wooden spoon i mean after seeing the reviewer flip at the fact that kenji didnt have a conversation with his wife instead of hiding his fried chicken you shouldve realized the review needed to be viewed with skepticism if they couldnt pick up on the fact that was  humor  and not a real marital issue their perception is quite colored
gnjbj5n,Cooking,he was born kenji alt and his wifes given last name was lopez and they both changed their names to lopez alt sound like a misogynist to you
gnj7ogb,Cooking,because you havent even read the book youre just making up things to get offended over
gnj6gae,Cooking,how is saying i realised that my distaste for vegetables is entirely my mothers fault sr to break it to you ma what exactly is misogynistic at that sentence in your personal opinion he realized that his mother didnt know how to cook veggies right and that he didnt like it because of that and not some innate hatred for veggies same with the other quote he didnt go there and just wrote that he hits his wife on the regular he made a gender neutral joke while explaining that a wooden kitchen spoon is a staple in the kitchen he wrote gently slap spouses gender neutral term who disturb you in the kitchen how is that even remotely sexist mysoginistic or hateful to you if you read these reviews and think that they have legitimate complaints you are probably one of these people that rate something on amazon   star cause shipping got delayed by   days and btw have you asked his wife if she is also amazingly annoyed with his writing not everyone has the same fragility and problems in their relationships and you and others projecting relationship problems into that when you have never met any of the two is so stupid it hurts
gnj5smh,Cooking,good bot
gnl1hzc,Cooking,no one seems to say anything but that s it s justified for people to call david chang a cunt but now everyone wants to freak out and say no male chef is ever criticized just to defend samin lol
gnj5ngx,Cooking,removed
gnj67ry,Cooking,removed
gnjooqo,Cooking,probably the same reason you re so quick to label it as such solely because it s a  largely documented phenomenon  he wants context and you want narrative
gnj5ouv,Cooking,you re the second person to give examples of other women to prove a point there is a difference between finding all women  self congratulatory  and comparing how you d feel about a particular person to how you d feel if she specifically were a man i m asking about the latter not to disprove the former edit  nvm you re the same person hello again oh and misogyny like any other form of oppression exists on a vastly wide spectrum pointing out or in this case simply asking a question about possible motivations areas where it manifests more subtly is not  trivializing  it
gnjd4gr,Cooking,when that genre is then carried over too cookbooks though where theyre competing against those written by non tv chefs it seems like a valid criticism of the book
gnjr8wd,Cooking,no im not
gnjoezd,Cooking,i guess i just find it strange that i generally see him praised in here and every time literally every time nosrat is mentioned in here multiple people pipe up with the shes so full of herself comments i think a lot of people just dont find her likable and if they did they would call it confidence instead of arrogance which is human nature we tend to come up with a cognitive framework and then adjust interpretations based on that framework that said i dont really feel like arguing about this because this argument happens every time someone posts about this book and its always the same i regret even commenting because i knew where it was going
gniu1w4,Cooking,no one thinks that thats sort of the point
gnjoch2,Cooking,yeah so many things are like that so and so does it like this so  this  is the only way to do it because thats how i learned it when i started cooking and never once questioned or tested the theory except no no its not its not even the best way to do it grind my gears right up there with the gatekeeping around cast iron care
gnjfhhi,Cooking,got it thanks
gnj8ujj,Cooking,guess ill have to read the book now wont i you can have fatty things that dont feel that rich stuff like heavy cream or even cheese has more fat than avocados but dont feel nearly as rich
gnl2qzx,Cooking,no male chef is ever criticized i didnt say that no male chef is every criticized nor that there arent any women who are celebrated for their success im saying its an overall trend that women are encouraged to downplay their hard work and achievements its a subtle thing probably resulting a lot from implicit unintentional bias and not intentional sexism and in terms of arrogance samin hardly registers compared to most celebrity chefs so it just seems weird to me that people would have that opinion of her if samin is arrogant and annoying then practically every celebrity chef is even more so
gnj5smv,Cooking,we can agree to disagree here it works for me it doesn t work for you that doesn t mean i have to  admit  anything
gnjhfwt,Cooking,okay chill out this kind of abusive language is not welcome here
gnjpg8n,Cooking,the context is clear ive never seen anyone complain about gordon ramsey on his sub but apparently a lot of people think samin is full of it thats pretty wild man if you dont see it or at least give the benefit of the doubt that its happening you might be part of the problem
gnjiocj,Cooking,i think the point is that accusations of misogyny are being leveled with zero evidence except that the subject of the criticism is a woman its frustrating and stressful for people to have their opinions dismissed and have it turned around on them as being born out if sexism racism etc its a too easy way to shut down strangers on the internet when you dont like what they have to say
gnjrhsv,Cooking,i dont find that very convincing
gnjovmm,Cooking,its just sexism misogyny sexist misogynistic people will never admit to it they cant be they have daughters and sisters and moms
gnjr296,Cooking,i guess we frequent differnet spaces because i see him criticised all the time i dont see why people not finding someone likeable needs to lead down the path so many here are trying to steer it down
gnivfg1,Cooking,what are you talking about
gnl3fhu,Cooking,then practically every celebrity chef is even more so see this isn t that wild of a take a great many of them are generally considered exceptionally insufferable
gnj62hh,Cooking,removed
gnjqtxt,Cooking,people shit on david chang like there s no tomorrow for being a condescending full of himself prick people shit on ramsey regardless of your narrative quite a bit but it s usually overshadowed by the good he does for the industry and cute clips of him with kids you don t care about facts but it s simply accurate that he doesn t do the particular thing they re complaining about form samin sounds like you want to throw sexism in because  you  don t like gordon but love samin you want to demand we all believe the inverse because you do and anyone that disagrees is sexist and  part of the problem  samin is fantastic and i can happily say that having met her but you re lying to yourself if you don t think she name drops to a downright silly degree
gnkm3tv,Cooking,i hear you and i understand that it must be frustrating to feel as though youre being told that any opinion that criticizes a women must inherently be attributed to sexism i want to point out that i have not been saying that  rather ive been questioning whether its  possible  that in this particular case misogyny could be playing a role in how people perceive samin on the individual level the answer could very well be no but i have reasons for asking this question that are more nuanced than people are giving me credit for its a well documented phenomenon that perceived gender influences peoples perception of a situation in unconscious ways a   study  https  pdfs semanticscholar org f b  b eb f d fa eecebb a  pdf set up an experiment to measure participants perceptions of who talked more in a recorded conversation with two speakers participants consistently reported that the woman in the conversation talked the most even when she didnt across a large group of subjects and four dialogues we found that the contribution of a female speaker to a mixed sex conversation was systematically judged as greater than that of a male speaker although in fact the contributions were identical in general both male and female listeners showed this effect and they showed it both when they were tested by a male experimenter and when they were tested by a female experimenter in a more recent anecdotal example a  man  https  twitter com i events   and a  woman  https  nickyknacks medium com working while female a de ad  ginj xk  switched work emails for two weeks to compare their treatment because she had been criticized for being slow with clients she was able to work with her clients much more quickly when she was perceived as a man and he encountered frustration and difficulty trying to do the same when he was perceived as a woman these are just two examples of how gender affects our perceptions and biases even and especially when were not aware of it while i agree that constant callouts can be unproductive and unfair especially if theyre unnuanced its not a terrible thing to suggest that someone examine why they feel a certain way feelings dont just come from nowhere  theyre sourced in our biases attitudes and unfortunately the society were raised in so when i say i wonder if youd feel the same way if she were a man im not saying ragh how dare you not love her you must hate women im  honestly saying  that id be curious to see if samin were not a woman whether or not people would perceive her differently
gnjs6hm,Cooking,i wasnt trying to convince you you asked me a question and i gave an answer
gnjqjh3,Cooking,why do you feel its misogyny
gnj65jl,Cooking,removed
gnjrb0y,Cooking,im just going off of data and what im seeing and experiencing you seem to be having a knee jerk reaction here its weird that you dont think i care about facts when youre the one kind of flailing right now
gnjsvdu,Cooking,i never said you were trying to convince me im simply stating what you said is not very convincing
gnjr32k,Cooking,i never see this much talk about gordon ramsey even though his personality is   times more aggressive yet somehow this pretty charismatic and warm woman is somehow too self congratulatory its wild man why do you feel like its not misogyny sexism
lkr4tc,Cooking,does anyone else enjoy using hungarian paprika and what dishes do you use it in that aren t typical i bought a large container of it online to make chicken paprikash and goulash and i think it is the best thing ever now i use it constantly and before i only used smoked paprika i just wanted to see if there were some other fun uses for it out there
gnlc28m,Cooking,one of my family favorites is potato wedges with paprika salt better garlic powder and onion powder mix cut up potatoes with those spices a bit of olive oil and bake at   degrees f until done
gnlgcii,Cooking,i recently discovered hungarian sausages at my local butcher i need more now
gnlebxh,Cooking,it goes well in tomato sauces generally i fry it with the veg for a spanish omelette and mix it with cumin coriander and chili powders to sprinkle on oven chips id been disappointed by the supermarket paprika but i recently found a hungarian shop nearby called paprika and theirs is a definite improvement
gnlf2s5,Cooking,oh dang i havent had chicken paprikash in several years i should look into making some again my mom made the best to me cp but shes on the wrong side of the country from me thank you for pinging that memory   have a lovely day
gnlbzwe,Cooking,yep so good i greatly prefer it to smoked paprika i do a lot of cajun cooking and paprika is a nice spice to work in with the other peppers i feel like it s never bad to add in basically any cajun dish that calls for red pepper
gnlq7y1,Cooking,yup believe it or not the top notch european foods or ingredients arent necessarily italian spanish french  theyre just the most vocal about it hungarian salami   paprika german ham seriously if you like prosciutto or iberian ham try some fucking actual westphalian ham can be world class gnocchi fuck that  halusky is far better parmesan is great  but a good emmentaler or comte is better san marzano tomatoes meh  theyre just decent canned tomatoes my opinion only   just a rant but i think food t v has really warped peoples perception im assuming spain   italy spend a huge amount of money on pr edit  make sure to try the hot hungarian paprika too and youd damn well better make some gypsy bacon at least once look it up as well as lango
gnlnop7,Cooking,chicken paprikash and arroz con pollo are my ultimate comfort foods   ill use sweet  hot paprika and garlic powder on roasted veggies of all kinds and especially chickpeas or just with some oil and salt and crushed garlic to roast a chicken
gnlrhpy,Cooking,my gf is   hungarian her mom smuggled a shitload of it in for us including the paste use it all the time
gnljtvr,Cooking,besides using it for chicken i mix it with some salt and pepper to create a dry dip for plain steamed broccoli and cauliflower sounds rather dull but its so good i also use it when i make sichuan hot oil the recipe is from chinese cooking demystified not sure if i can link it here

gnlvr92,Cooking,if you like mushrooms look up hungarian mushroom soup simply amazing with a generous dose of paprika
gnlwzkq,Cooking,i use it in bread dressing stuffing for thanksgiving style turkey in addition to the traditional spices sage thyme
gnlxmzm,Cooking,you got it just make sure you have speatzle as your side dish for the paprikash
gnm2vf5,Cooking,my old company had offices in hungary whenever someone goes out their i would always ask them to bring me back some paprika that stuff is my crack
gnm7xo3,Cooking,ha my discovery went in the opposite direction from hungarian to spanish smoked
gnmckct,Cooking,hungary has a version of grape wrapped rice forgive my ignorance of the dish s name it s something my step dad s late mother made it s full of paprika and lovely
gnmq9xg,Cooking,hungarian paprika is delish its intensely smoked brethren spanish smoked paprika is also amazing
gnmr8n1,Cooking,we can buy them at the supermarket in a jar  roasted peeled and pickled i often drain a part of the pickling water and blend the lest into a paprika sauce which is a perfect ingredient for a goulash it is especially good as ingredient for a shashlik sauce or my lazy variant the shashlik goulash  all the ingredients for a good shashlik but i dont make kebabs out of the ingredients i just fry them and add them to the sauce and let them simmer
gnn29j0,Cooking,i use it in fajitas it mixes well with turmeric for thai style dishes it s got a place in any spice mix i make for bbq if you want the traditional hungarian route stuffed cabbage can t be overlooked
gnn4qkg,Cooking,when frying chicken cutlets or a pork chop add some paprika and garlic powder to the breading adds a wonderful flavor to anything tbh
gnnfyzb,Cooking,it is truly the best paprika
gnlpvi0,Cooking,its used in southern cooking esp cajun cooking its an ingredient in many commercially available cajun spice blends
gnlpqzf,Cooking,i do my potatoes in a similar way but i add sausage and coarse chopped onions to it i usually use polska kielbasa but i ve been on a brand called conecuh lately which is a hickory smoked sausage easy cheap and quick dinner that is super filling and always creates tons of leftovers
gnlp4oq,Cooking,lived in e europe for a while and i can tell you that when we wanted to eat something special we drove to hungary people that like salami   think italian salami is necesarily the best or more authentic are really missing out too
gnlsmvt,Cooking,yeah places like hungary and germany do not get the credit they deserve the food is wonderful and i would love to visit these countries but most people may not view their cuisine as being  refined
gnmdfy9,Cooking,i have to push back on your comment on emmentaler or comte being better than parmesan though two totally different kinds of cheeses
gnm8tzq,Cooking,i wouldnt say thay spain spends too much money on pr for the stuff that we actually manage to get out there if we do spend the money on pr we are doing stuff wrong the italian and french are the great ones at this otherwise people would also know about our paprika which is also world class and some of our other products that are as special as serrano ham and possibly more exportable   i absolutely agree that food tv can be damaging and tends to focus on the same countries while completely ignoring other amazing gastronomic ideas i specially hate how this tends to also end up with certain products recipes of those countries being the only thing ever to exist think about spain and paella this is a regional dish but somehow it became associated with the country and it is what people expect to see everywhere it also doesnt help that most people that cook it have zero background on what they are doing it ends up being an example of cultural misrepresentation and it bothers me a lot it actually made me approach food from other cultures from a much more intentional perspective but that is a different story i cant agree with your parmesan affirmation i think it is better than emmentaler but it is a matter of my personal taste   i am particular about cow cheeses also i thought emmentaler was super famous though maybe only around europe i am very curious about the halusky from what i read on wikipedia i am imagining them like a potatoey sp tzle and that sounds fantastic could you   by chance   point me to a good source to start learning more and my contribution to underrated countries for food and products  romania they also have fantastic salamis and cheeses and cured meats in general the gastronomy is fantastic and many recipes are accesible enough for people i cant understand how it hasnt boomed yet
gnmdkff,Cooking,its paprika powder made in hungary
gnlyo16,Cooking,hungarian paprika is a bit sweeter with less of a smokey flavor in hungarian dishes they will use heaping amounts of it it seems that it is their main spice and it s even on restaurant tables just like salt and pepper in many other countries it s quite a bit different and i use it to spice up my food for a unique flavor
gnlwo8z,Cooking,ill make a big batch while food prepping the wedges are really good with eggs for breakfast cold with a sandwich or warmed with just about any kind of meat
gnm0mfi,Cooking,conecuh has been our family go to brand for years now hands down my favorite link sausage edit  central mississippi here
gnn9wxa,Cooking,conecuh is the superior smoked sausage
gnnhe2v,Cooking,conecuh sausage might be the best thing to ever come out of alabama
gnlujgi,Cooking,totally when i lived in sk there was a place cant remember where that just served a klobasa on a piece of rye bread nothing else  just a  really  good sausage on a piece of bread with some of the grease poured on it that was the menu youll never see it on tv or mentioned on some food blog but id take that over some fancy overpriced pasta any day of the week and at the time it cost like fifty cents if that you could put some chives on it or brag about where the bread came from i guess but they wouldnt think in those terms at all it was just that place has a good sausage   im sure the name of the place was sausage name of street or something like whatever nobody cares i think theres a big cultural difference as in some nationalities just dont like to brag as much as others i remember my gf at the time   we were in some town on a day trip   getting  royally  pissed at me for stopping for like ten seconds to take a pic of the local castle she said you can just buy a postcard with a better picture of it anyways so quit being a dumbfuck tourist   its cold out   we have somewhere to be
gnmfh9k,Cooking,oh very much so but personally i like to cook with them more than parmesan and also eat plain more than parmesan too if it comes down purely to eating by itself id have to honestly go with roquefort or maybe a very long aged gouda but am not sure if thats a legit cheese or just some weird stuff that they sell at trader joes its tasty as fuck though would take a dry aged provolone or pecorino or a good name protected gorgonzola over any parmesan though just my opinion of course
gnmexrl,Cooking,hehehe hey cool i just had to tease a little bit   and anyways as long as youre ok with badmouthing the italians a little bit you spaniards are all right with me   just giving everyone a hard time for no reason  we americans like to kid but dont usually mean too much by it so halusky is many things to many people  but what i was referring to was halusky bryndzove nothing fancy just boiled potato dumplings with a sauce made of fresh sheeps cheese fried onions and bacon you fry the onions with the bacon and then put them on top of the dumpling   sheep cheese sauce   im sure you guys would have a similar dish or maybe at least a basque one and yes romanian food deserves more credit too what especially weird is that their language actually makes sense so it  should  in theory be more accessible to western europeans americans as opposed to slavic languages or god forbid magyarsko or whatever its properly called   i wouldnt even dare to try they have some weird prejudice against vowels i guess very hard to wrap ones head around
gnm41is,Cooking,so its smokier then regular paprika but not as smoky as smoked paprika
gnmb7bi,Cooking,it  is  regular paprika
gnmjii1,Cooking,so what makes it hungarian why would i buy specifically hungarian paprika if its just regular paprika whats the difference
gnmrhhl,Cooking,its a different species of paprika with a unique flavor the taste is similar to a bell pepper since they are both paprika but it is still different its like how all cheese are cheese but not completely the same i dont know how to describe the taste difference bell pepper has this completely unique bell pepper flavor that i hate on its own hungarian paprika is different its not as strong on its that it overpowers the dish more like compliments it
gnmvl8r,Cooking,bell peppers are really sweet imo and our paprika has a much more toned down sweetness to it while still keeping that paprika flavor cant really describe it more mellow while still keeping that earthy ness id never put bell pepper in my stews as they would sweeten it too much imo while we put teaspoons of paprika in stews gulashes etc we have smoked paprika as well but sometimes you dont need the smokey flavour just the slight sweetness and of course the color there is also a lot of types of paprika powder depending on what paprika is it made from
gnngft6,Cooking,its grown in hungary from hungarian varieties of peppers it can be a bit different from spanish paprika but is largely interchangeable
gnng0l2,Cooking,almost all commerical peppers are the same species capsicum annuum only a handful of commerical chiles come from the other four cultivated species and theyre typically hotter or just used in latin america
gnnj9bi,Cooking,that is very nice that its the same family but there are so many varieties of it the spice they are referring to is made from  capsicum annuum var longum   this type can also have spicy and sweet paprika too  capsicum annuum var grossum  is called apple paprika and it is slightly spicy theres also another kind grown in hungary  capsicum annuum var cerasiforme   which is a bit more spicy so yeah technically all of them belong to the same species but they do have different properties
ll64hi,Cooking,so i ordered peking duck meal kit and when reheating the fat rendered out and decided to keep it not sure how to use it so would love to hear what you favourite way to incorporate it in other dishes
gnnl0q5,Cooking,roast potatoes with it
gnnmihm,Cooking,make some flour tortillas
gnnla6s,Cooking,my mom makes duck dressing with the leftover fat really flavorful and now it s the only way i like my dressing
gnnmknn,Cooking,scrambled eggs are pretty awesome with it roasting veggies in general is great especially harder thicker ones that take a bit more time to roast potatoes parsnips carrots etc
gnnmyiy,Cooking,use it in lieu of butter when making an omelette its amazing
gnnocw7,Cooking,i have goose fat and i only knew to roast vegetables mostly root vegetables in it so this thread is very interesting to me
gnnn1nk,Cooking,this recipe specifically https  www seriouseats com recipes     the best roast potatoes ever recipe html
gnno336,Cooking,this sounds like a good idea cant wait to try it
ll5v20,Cooking,i m making homemade ramen for my wife s birthday she used to live in japan and we met in nyc so we ve never had shortage of good ramen but now we moved to another state where she has yet to be satisfied by the asian options we ve tried so i decided to surprise her with this i m using  this recipe from basics with babish  https  basicswithbabish co basicsepisodes tonkotsuramen and everything looks pretty straightforward but there is one major hurdle in the   hour wait time for the broth we have a toddler and as such our mornings are pretty hectic as it is making breakfast etc so i m wondering if the broth will suffer in quality or if anything weird will happen if i boil and clean out the pigs feet the night before and then the morning of all i need to do is get them back to the pot and boil for the requisite   hours alternatively does anyone have first hand experience making the broth on a pressure cooker or instant pot i m hesitant to do this because those shortcuts usually end up being almost but not quite the same so i m willing to try the real deal for the sake of quality however if anyone can vouch for ip ramen being just as good maybe i ll go that route thanks
gnnjlv4,Cooking,check out way of ramen on youtube for pressure cooker ideas
gnnkgpk,Cooking,not for ramen but when i make any broth or long simmered sauce i sometimes do   hours and   hours the next day so i think its okay
ll1enw,Cooking,i have a shellfish allergy but i ve always wanted to eat lobster shrimp etc people compare lobster to shrimp online and vice versa which obviously isn t helpful i can eat fish and pretty much every other type of food so could someone explain what lobster tastes like to me in a way that i would understand
gnmvmgb,Cooking,monkfish is a fish that is probably closest in texture to lobster
gnn2hcn,Cooking,people are going to think im crazy but   texturally   perfectly cooked lobster which is hard to get just right is like a really good hotdog perfect snap on the outside with a fairly uniform soft springy texture in the middle punctuated with pockets of juiciness there is another aspect to the texture which is harder to find outside of shellfish like shrimp or scallops but i think monkfish again needs to be cooked just right was a good suggestion flavour wise its a pretty mild sweet and delicate briny flavour which is usually pretty heavily dominated by whatever compound butter its served with
gnmyl91,Cooking,youre really not missing that much a lot of what people like is this kind of firm but juicy texture what theyre really responding to though is the lemon garlic butter the closest thing ive eaten to lobster outside the shellfish world isnt fish its steamed artichoke with lemon garlic butter dipping sauce
gnn4hzi,Cooking,it s one of the most overhyped foods if you ask me the texture is like someone said maybe a little comparable to a hotdog so a snappy skin but the flesh texture is more like dense spongy fish i guess then the taste of the lobster itself is is salty mildly fishy and sweet not sugary or fruity but a light sweetness crab is heavier and more pungent it s good but i could easily go the rest of my life never eating again without missing it
gnn1sbr,Cooking,i had lobster today for the first time in   years and this is what i thought  it tastes like a giant shrimp  as you haven t tasted shrimp i d describe it as a really mild white fish with the juices tasting like really mild flavour of sweet seawater i wouldn t be too upset if it takes another   years before i try another lobster
gnmwqvs,Cooking,if you are very curious about what lobster tastes like you could try lobster mushrooms hypomyces lactifluorum they are expensive but i heard about them from vegans who are raving about just how much they actually taste like lobster and many pescetarians have confirmed that they actually taste just like lobster but the texture is a little different but taste wise       it pretty much exactly tastes like lobster lobster mushrooms can be a hard to find definitely a specialty ingredient and they are very seasonal so i think you mainly can get them late summer early autumn  here is a place that sells the mushrooms but they have a waiting list right now  https  www vivagourmet com product lobster mushroom for sale i think you can find them sold dried and dehydrated aswell depending on where you are in the world you might be able to forage your own
gnmwm3z,Cooking,do they sell fake lobster in your area and could you eat that its vaguely close in taste and iirc its made from fish
gnn119t,Cooking,it tastes like butter
gnmzefm,Cooking,it has a sweet and salty taste
gnn6j2n,Cooking,i developed a shellfish allergy at age   so i got to taste everything before honestly it s not something i miss much lobster is ok i don t think it s all it s hyped up to be on the other hand i also developed an egg allergy at the same time and i miss eggs so much
gnn965g,Cooking,with lobster youre not missing much the shellfish flavor is mild similar to how tilapia is a mild fish flavor the flavor experience is light but rich at the same time its also very easy to be done wrong or overcooked the mouthfeel is a bit hard to describe with a comparison the casing of a hotdogs is close as others have mention but the interior is not the the same it doesnt have the finely ground texture of a hotdogs but more of a lighter and fluffier meat or flesh unprocessed anywho its more of a butter spoon than anything else imo shrimp on the other hand is amazing there are a lot of varieties but your typical shrimp will have a scent of the sea a slight brinyness and sometimes the slightest hint of sweetness if you mix the savory flavor of garlic and the acidity of lemon shrimp is the missing piece of a perfect culinary trifecta they just compliment each other so well it can be soft and tender if boiled or steamed it can have a slight bite to it if pan fried it can have a crispy exterior if grilled like char the exterior is like a plump wedge of a cutie orange a bit of snap but in a good way the texture and mouthfeel is definitely denser or less delicate than lobster i know that doesnt help but definitely lighter than say a grilled chicken breast or chicken tenderloin id almost compare it to a medium or medium rare duck breast but with an ocean or briny overtone instead of a game flavor
gnmwmxn,Cooking,can you get away with sachets for ramen especially the seafood ones in the uk we have prawn cocktail crisps which have probably never been near a prawn
gnmxg3w,Cooking,like lobster tails its not really worth your life or health
gnn6nqv,Cooking,having read all the responses seems like you need to buy some lobster mushrooms blitz them up into a powder and use that in a marinade for a hunk of monkfish voila lobster facsimile
gnn70kn,Cooking,the shell has more taste than the meat i hate shrimp and lobster texture but love using the shells for sauce soup etc it tastes like how the ocean smells but sweeter
gnn7jqt,Cooking,are you allergic to bugs lobsters are bugs if you steam a bunch of crickets and dip them in lemon butter it should be similar
gnnbxui,Cooking,lobster is kind of chewy slightly sweet idk i did my best
gnnklaz,Cooking,scallops basically they taste like scallops
gnmvb4d,Cooking,shrimp kinda tastes like a piece of fresh salmon but more firm in texture a bit lighter it flavor like a salmon and chicken breast hybrid lobster tastes like shrimp but a bit sweeter literally like its sweet in comparison i don t like lobster since that sweet flavor puts me off but i love shrimp
gnn9b4i,Cooking,its a delicious food especially eaten and enjoyed in the summer with some atmosphere of the place i think it is ridiculously over rated at cheesy restaurant chains that offer frozen surf and turf kind of menus if ever there were a dumb idea that is it langoustines even worse but north altlantic homard eaten in the summer in a new england coastal village perhaps like in wiscasset maine at a lobster pound fresh and briny or at a seaside clam bake in sea weed somewhere downeast is true  ambrosia at  https  ambrosia at a mediocre chain or place far from the source or frozen it is just a shadow of itself mediocre and to be avoided my favorite lobster pound and there are so many is cape porpoise in the rough or better yet take a sail to gosport harbor on the isle of shoals that straddles the maine nh border and radio in a fresh lobster role from your sail boat that is fresh and living life yum ipswich estuary and the towns farther south in ma beyond salisbury cape ann gloucester essex ipswich and the tidal flats are also excellent eating spots as well for traditional best at its freshest save your lobster experience for the local and avoid the restaurant or supermarket crap
gnmvwut,Cooking,ah yes the goblins of the sea i m going to have to find a restaurant with a good monkfish dish to test it out thanks for the suggestion
gnn87o9,Cooking,you can sous vide lobster and get the proper texture every time also a lot of people are used to the fresh water lobster thats been sitting in the store for weeks get cold water ocean lobster and ii will hold its own
gnn927b,Cooking,i completely agree
gnmwv8t,Cooking,that s wild i ve never heard of those before but i m definitely going to try to get my hands on some thanks for the link
gnmwram,Cooking,i could probably hunt some of that down i m in la so i m sure it s not too hard to come by thanks
gnmvjnc,Cooking,interesting i feel like i can picture how the shrimp tastes but how sweet are we talking in regards to the lobster like as sweet as a banana or is it more subtle
gnn57rm,Cooking,in addition to these there are lion mane mushrooms that are also incredibly similar in flavor
gnmy11q,Cooking,just make sure to buy the cheaper ones because the more expensive imitation lobster do contain a certain percentage of real lobster meat in them carefully read the packaging before buying
gnmw02r,Cooking,its subtle but noticeable its been a while because i don t like it
gnnk1vh,Cooking,i think they are more scallop like which is not to criticize your comment good mushroom suggestion
ll6j0w,Cooking,i feel like every time i make veggies burgers usually with brown rice they always fall apart also the dont really fry that well any thoughts more egg glue
gnnnfvk,Cooking,check out chia seeds soak them in some water and they get pretty sticky and are great for holding stuff together
gnnn4tq,Cooking,try to mix some breadcrumbs in
gnnnwj0,Cooking,guarantee you i will find a way to fuck that up but thanks
